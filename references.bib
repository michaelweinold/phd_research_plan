              Improving the efficiency of algorithms for fundamental computations can have a widespread impact, as it can affect the overall speed of a large amount of computations. Matrix multiplication is one such primitive task, occurring in many systems—from neural networks to scientific computing routines. The automatic discovery of algorithms using machine learning offers the prospect of reaching beyond human intuition and outperforming the current best human-designed algorithms. However, automating the algorithm discovery procedure is intricate, as the space of possible algorithms is enormous. Here we report a deep reinforcement learning approach based on AlphaZero
              1
              for discovering efficient and provably correct algorithms for the multiplication of arbitrary matrices. Our agent, AlphaTensor, is trained to play a single-player game where the objective is finding tensor decompositions within a finite factor space. AlphaTensor discovered algorithms that outperform the state-of-the-art complexity for many matrix sizes. Particularly relevant is the case of 4 × 4 matrices in a finite field, where AlphaTensor’s algorithm improves on Strassen’s two-level algorithm for the first time, to our knowledge, since its discovery 50 years ago
              2
              . We further showcase the flexibility of AlphaTensor through different use-cases: algorithms with state-of-the-art complexity for structured matrix multiplication and improved practical efficiency by optimizing matrix multiplication for runtime on specific hardware. Our results highlight AlphaTensor’s ability to accelerate the process of algorithmic discovery on a range of problems, and to optimize for different criteria.},

              Low-carbon (green) hydrogen can be generated
              via
              water electrolysis using photovoltaic, wind, hydropower, or decarbonized grid electricity. This work quantifies current and future costs as well as environmental burdens of large-scale hydrogen production systems on geographical islands, which exhibit high renewable energy potentials and could act as hydrogen export hubs. Different hydrogen production configurations are examined, considering a daily hydrogen production rate of 10 tonnes, on hydrogen production costs, life cycle greenhouse gas emissions, material utilization, and land transformation. The results demonstrate that electrolytic hydrogen production costs of 3.7 Euro per kg H
              2
              are within reach today and that a reduction to 2 Euro per kg H
              2
              in year 2040 is likely, hence approaching cost parity with hydrogen from natural gas reforming even when applying “historical” natural gas prices. The recent surge of natural gas prices shows that cost parity between green and grey hydrogen can already be achieved today. Producing hydrogen
              via
              water electrolysis with low costs and low GHG emissions is only possible at very specific locations nowadays. Hybrid configurations using different electricity supply options demonstrate the best economic performance in combination with low environmental burdens. Autonomous hydrogen production systems are especially effective to produce low-carbon hydrogen, although the production of larger sized system components can exhibit significant environmental burdens and investments. Some materials (especially iridium) and the availability of land can be limiting factors when scaling up green hydrogen production with polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyzers. This implies that decision-makers should consider aspects beyond costs and GHG emissions when designing large-scale hydrogen production systems to avoid risks coming along with the supply of, for example, scarce materials.},

The model is validated against selected literature studies for the climate change category. We then use Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) to evaluate the contribution of each parameter to the overall variance of the model's output. The results of the GSA suggest that i) the uncertainty of environmental impact estimates can be signiﬁcantly reduced by obtaining more accurate values for a small number of key parameters, such as the installed capacity of the plant, operational emissions of CO2 and the depth and capacity of wells; and ii) the majority of parameters do not affect signiﬁcantly the environmental impact estimates and therefore can be ﬁxed anywhere within their range of variability. Finally, we discuss some of the limitations of the present study and propose approaches that could be implemented to overcome such limitations.},

The model’s structure and inputs are based on data from the ﬁrst shale gas horizontal well in China. The IO model was constructed using the 2007 benchmark IO table for China. Results suggest shale-to-well energy use of 59 TJ and shale-to-well greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of 5500 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e). Shale-to-well energy use and air emissions were dominated by the production and use of diesel fuel for oil-based drilling ﬂuids and for on-site combustion, and by fugitive emissions and ﬂaring from well completion.

	abstract = {This study contributes to better understanding the interregional variability in vehicle carbon footprints and presents a case study of China’s electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure promotion plan (EVSE2020). Based on an integrated hybrid life-cycle assessment (LCA) with new regional electricity mixes and the Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) model with local inventories, the carbon footprints of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) are calculated for all size segments. For the Aclass segment, the most popular size segment, the results show that the carbon footprint of ICEVs is approximately 250.6 gCO2e/km. The BEV carbon footprint under a nationwide electricity mix is 217.6 gCO2e/km and ranges between 104.4 (Yunnan) and 265.7 (Shandong) gCO2e/km. These results can be explained by the proportion of coal in provincial electricity consumption mixes (10\% to 90\%). Out of the 31 provinces in mainland China, A-class BEVs driven in 26 provinces will reduce life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to ICEVs. In addition, the maximum BEV carbon footprint exceeds the minimum by 79\%–121\% owing to size segments, which is much higher than that for ICEVs, 59\%. The interprovincial variability in vehicle carbon footprints calls for modiﬁcations to the interregional priority assignments in the EVSE2020 plan, which currently focuses on air pollution control and economic status. After incorporating explicit considerations of climate mitigation, this study recommends raising the level of priority of three provinces in Central and Southwest China (Sichuan, Chongqing, and Hubei) in the EVSE2020 plan. For provinces with a high share of coal-based electricity, the development of BEVs of small size segments (A00/A0) should be encouraged.},

Oﬀshore installation and maintenance activities cause 28\% (10 g CO2Eq/kWh) of total greenhouse gas emissions and 31−45\% of total impact indicator values at the most (marine eutrophication, acidiﬁcation, particulates, photochemical ozone). Transport and dumping of rock in installation phase and maintenance of wind turbines in use phase are major contributory activities. Manufacturing of spare parts is responsible for 6\% (2 g CO2-Eq/ kWh) of greenhouse gas emissions and up to 13\% of total impact indicator values (freshwater ecotoxicity). Assumptions on lifetimes, work times for oﬀshore activities and implementation of NOx abatement on vessels are shown to have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on results.

	abstract = {This paper analyzes and compares the life cycle environmental impacts of two major types of Li-ion batteries using process-based and integrated hybrid life-cycle assessment (LCA) approaches. The life cycle inventories (LCIs) of Li-ion battery contain component production, battery assembly, use phase, disposal and recycling and other related background processes. For process-based LCA, 17 ReCiPe midpoint environmental impact indicators and three end point environmental impact indicators are considered. As for the integrated hybrid LCA study, life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and energy consumption are emphasized. Furthermore, we perform sensitivity analysis of life cycle GHG emissions with respect to the uncertainties in product prices, mass of BMS and cooling system, and production eﬃciency. The integrated hybrid LCA results show that battery cell production is the most signiﬁcant contributor to the life cycle GHG emissions and the economic input-output (EIO) systems contribute the largest part in life cycle energy consumption for both types of Li-ion batteries. The most signiﬁcant diﬀerence between two Li-ion batteries lies in the disposal and recycling stage. For LiMn2O4 (LMO) battery, the disposal and recycling stage only makes up a small portion of less than 10\% for life cycle GHG emissions and energy consumption. However, for Li(NixCoyMnz)O2 (NCM) battery, it contributes a signiﬁcant part at more than 20\%.},

	abstract = {China is the world’s largest manufacturer of multi-crystalline silicon photovoltaic (mc-Si PV) modules, which is a key enabling technology in the global transition to renewable electric power systems. This study presents a hybrid life-cycle inventory (LCI) of Chinese mc-Si PV modules, which ﬁlls a critical knowledge gap on the environmental implications of mc-Si PV module manufacturing in China. The hybrid LCI approach combines process-based LCI data for module and poly-silicon manufacturing plants with a 2007 China IO-LCI model for production of raw material and fuel inputs to estimate ‘cradle to gate’ primary energy use, water consumption, and major air pollutant emissions (carbon dioxide, methane, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxide, and nitrogen oxides). Results suggest that mc-Si PV modules from China may come with higher environmental burdens that one might estimate if one were using LCI results for mc-Si PV modules manufactured elsewhere. These higher burdens can be reasonably explained by the efﬁciency differences in China’s poly-silicon manufacturing processes, the country’s dependence on highly polluting coal-ﬁred electricity, and the expanded system boundaries associated with the hybrid LCI modeling framework. The results should be useful for establishing more conservative ranges on the potential ‘cradle to gate’ impacts of mc-Si PV module manufacturing for more robust LCAs of PV deployment scenarios.},

	abstract = {In order to mitigate the effects of global warming, companies are being compelled by governments, investors, and customers to control their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Similar to the European Union’s legislation on the airline industry, legislation is expected to require the electronics industry to assess their product’s carbon footprint before sale or use, as the electronics industry’s contribution to global GHG emissions is comparable to the airline industry’s contribution. Thus, it is necessary for members of the electronics industry to assess their current GHG emission rates and identify methods to reduce environmental impacts. Organizations use Carbon Footprint (CF) analysis methods to identify and quantify the GHG emissions associated with the life cycle stages of their product or services. This paper discusses the prevailing methods used by organizations to estimate the CF of their electronics products and identiﬁes the challenges faced by the electronics industry when adopting these methods in an environment of decreasing product development cycles with complex and diffuse supply chains. We ﬁnd that, as a result of the inconsistencies arising from the system boundary selection methods and databases, the use of outdated LCA approaches, and the lack of supplier’s emissions-related data, the CFs of electronic products are typically underestimated. To address these challenges, we present a comprehensive approach to the carbon footprinting of electronic products that involves the use of product-group-oriented standards, hybrid life cycle assessment techniques, and the integration of CF into products’ supply chains. A case study on commercial- and military-grade DC–DC buck converters demonstrating the recommended approach is presented.},

Life cycle assessment databases and multiregional input−output tables are adapted using forecasted changes in technology and resources up to 2050 under a 2 °C scenario. We call the result of this modeling “technology hybridized environmental-economic model with integrated scenarios” (THEMIS). As a case study, we apply THEMIS in an integrated environmental assessment of concentrating solar power. Life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions for this plant range from 33 to 95 g CO2 eq./kWh across diﬀerent world regions in 2010, falling to 30−87 g CO2 eq./kWh in 2050. Using regional life cycle data yields insightful results.

	title = {Comparative life cycle assessment of drinking straws in {Brazil}},
	abstract = {There have been numerous discussions about plastic drinking straws and their impacts on the natural environment, reﬂecting on public policies and companies’ operation, while alternatives to substituting plastic-based products have been proposed. However, making decisions without measuring trade-off conditions between the different scenarios may lead to higher impacts elsewhere on the life cycle or even in other areas of protection. To deepen this discussion, this paper aimed to quantify the potential environmental impacts of different drinking straws as well as ﬁnd possible break-even situations. A comparative life cycle assessment (LCA) was performed to assess six different drinking straws (plastic, stainless steel, glass, paper, bamboo and jute) from cradle-to-grave. A hybrid life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) method was applied following the characterization models recommended by ILCD. Sensitivity analyses included reuse rate, washing condition, the ancillary kits usage, End-of-Life (EoL) strategies and the inclusion of an indicator to account for the marine litter impacts from Life Cycle Inventory (LCI). Results showed that for baseline scenarios, plastic drinking straws have a better environmental performance if compared to reusable straws and has a favourable performance in 10 of 11 categories if compared to paper drinking straws. Water and detergent consumptions during the use phase and the manufacturing of additional elements (bag, brush) are the main drivers for this potentially higher environmental impact. Sensitivity analyses, however, showed that certain consumption patterns may lead to a break-even situation, especially when plastic drinking straws are disposed incorrectly into the natural ecosystem. Accounting for the impacts of marine litter may lead to a change in the decisionmaking depending on the signiﬁcance (weight) attributed to the marine litter indicator. These outcomes reinforce the importance of understanding trade-offs during the entire life cycle of products and demonstrate that policies directed to product substitution should be carefully grounded. Recommendations on reusable straws rely on simplifying their “kits”, expanding reuse rates and improving the washing process. For single use straws, waste collection and correct disposal are mandatory. The lack of a LCIA methodology to account for the environmental impact of mismanaged plastic waste on ecosystems, especially in the marine compartment represents an important issue to be further developed, from which, more realistic scenarios could be outlined for any product.},

Results and Discussion. Results show that the vehicle use phase is responsible for approximately 70\% of total emissions of CO2 for all three modes. This confirms that tailpipe emissions underestimate total emissions of freight transportation as infrastructure, pre-combustion, as well as vehicle manufacturing and EOL account for a sizeable share of total emissions. Depending on mode and pollutant, differences between tailpipe emissions and total systemwide emissions can range from only 4\% for road transportation's CO emissions to an almost tenfold difference for air transportation's PM10 emissions.
Conclusion. Rail freight has the lowest associated air emissions, followed by road and air transportation. Depending on the pollutant, rail is 50–94\% less polluting than road. Air transportation is rated the least efficient in terms of air emissions, partly due to the fact that it carries low weight cargo. It emits 35 times more CO2 than rail and 18 times more than road transportation on a ton-mile basis. It is important to consider infrastructure, vehicle manufacturing, and pre-combustion processes, whose life-cycle share is likely to increase as new tailpipe emission standards are enforced.},

The development of low-carbon concretes is pursued worldwide to help the construction industry make its contribution to decarbonising the built environment and achieving carbon reduction targets agreed under the Paris Climate Agreement. However, there is uncertainty around the actual amount of greenhouse gas emissions that can be avoided by employing alternative types of concrete. This study quantiﬁes the carbon footprint intensities of Australian cement and concrete production, including ordinary Portland cement, standard ordinary Portland cement concrete, blended cement-based concrete and geopolymer concrete production. For the ﬁrst time, an inputoutput based hybrid life-cycle assessment method is used for these products. The main goal of this paper is therefore to make a methodological comparison between process-based and hybrid life cycle assessment using the Australian cement and concrete production as a case study. A comparison with published results from process-based life-cycle inventories as well as a decomposition of results into product categories is provided. The hybrid life cycle assessment resulted in higher greenhouse gas emissions for ordinary Portland cement and all types of concrete due to the methodology incorporating an economy-wide system boundary, which includes the emissions from upstream processes. For geopolymer concrete in particular, the results were also dependent on the method applied for allocating greenhouse gas emissions from ﬂy ash and slag. The ﬁndings from this study are likely to inform the development of strategies and policies aimed at greenhouse gas reduction in the cement and concrete industries.},

However, due to the binary reaction and selflimiting nature of the ALD process, its life cycle environmental impact is signiﬁcant but has never been investigated before. This study is conducted using a hybrid life cycle assessment (LCA) approach for evaluating the comprehensive environmental impacts of the ALD process based on the typical ALD of Al2O3 high-k dielectric gate on semiconductors. The hybrid life cycle inventory analysis is conducted using process-based LCA data, economic inputeoutput LCA data, and stoichiometric simulation data for a robust LCA study. The impact assessments are conducted using the TRACI method, with both original and U.S. normalized impact results analyzed. Normalized impact results show that, among the twelve selected impact categories, ALD produces the highest impact in the category of fossil fuels use which is 108 times that of the least impact in air acidiﬁcation potential. Signiﬁcant differences are also observed among the environmental impacts of the ALD life cycle stages. The environmental impacts associated with the auxiliary infrastructure, equipment, and tools for ALD operation are intensive mainly due to the slow ALD cycling process. This hybrid LCA study provides a comprehensive data support for understanding the potential environmental impacts of ALD nanotechnology and is useful for sustainable scaleup of the ALD technology in future.},

This study presents a framework of economic evaluation and environmental assessment for two TEG-based dehydration approaches, namely, conventional dehydration process and stripping gas dehydration process. The latter one features a higher solvent concentration, at the expense of extra shale gas loss. On the basis of process simulation, the effects of theoretical stage and solvent concentration on economic and environmental performances are investigated for process optimization. A hybrid life cycle inventory (LCI) model that consists of input-output and process-based methods is developed to evaluate the environmental impacts associated with shale gas dehydration. The results show that utility consumption and shale gas loss are dominant sources for the emissions of CO2 and NOx, while soot is mainly derived from embodied emissions. Based on the tradeoff between the total annual cost and environmental impacts, the optimal case with superior economic and environmental performances is acquired. Ultimately, sensitivity analyses are conducted for systematic comparison of two approaches under different compositions of raw shale gas and speciﬁcations of water removal.},

	abstract = {Hybrid life cycle assessment (LCA) incorporating process-based and economic input-output (EIO)-based inventory data has been applied in various industries (e.g., wind energy, biofuel). Few hybrid LCA studies have been found in the food industry. This work analyzes the life cycle environmental impacts of the U.S. beef processing industry using process-based and integrated hybrid LCA. The process-based inventory includes all resource inputs and waste outputs associated with beef processing plant. The EIO-based inventory includes key activities missing in the process-based inventory, such as technical and management service, wood and paper, and industrial equipment. Ten environmental impact categories from TRACI v2.1 and one aggregated environmental single score are considered. The results show that environmental impact from EIO-based inventory contributes a meaningful fraction of the impact for ozone depletion (67\%), respiratory effects (42\%), fossil fuel depletion (38\%), and smog (28\%) (as opposed to process-based inventory). These results emphasize the relative potential for the U.S. beef processing industry of greening the supply chain (e.g., technical and management services, industrial equipment) to reduce environmental impacts. Furthermore, we perform uncertainty and global sensitivity analysis for key parameters of all environmental categories. The uncertainty analysis showed that the environmental impacts contributed by EIO system can range from 7\% to 15\% under Monte Carlo simulations (10,000 runs) when representing the impacts using an aggregated environmental single score. The global sensitivity analysis using Sobol method for all environmental categories shows that the electricity, natural gas, and wastewater treatment from process system and beef price from EIO system are the four most sensitive parameters to all ten TRACI environmental categories and the environmental single score. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {In order to mitigate the effects of global warming, companies are being compelled by governments, investors, and customers to control their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Similar to the European Union’s legislation on the airline industry, legislation is expected to require the electronics industry to assess their product’s carbon footprint before sale or use, as the electronics industry’s contribution to global GHG emissions is comparable to the airline industry’s contribution. Thus, it is necessary for members of the electronics industry to assess their current GHG emission rates and identify methods to reduce environmental impacts. Organizations use Carbon Footprint (CF) analysis methods to identify and quantify the GHG emissions associated with the life cycle stages of their product or services. This paper discusses the prevailing methods used by organizations to estimate the CF of their electronics products and identiﬁes the challenges faced by the electronics industry when adopting these methods in an environment of decreasing product development cycles with complex and diffuse supply chains. We ﬁnd that, as a result of the inconsistencies arising from the system boundary selection methods and databases, the use of outdated LCA approaches, and the lack of supplier’s emissions-related data, the CFs of electronic products are typically underestimated. To address these challenges, we present a comprehensive approach to the carbon footprinting of electronic products that involves the use of product-group-oriented standards, hybrid life cycle assessment techniques, and the integration of CF into products’ supply chains. A case study on commercial- and military-grade DC–DC buck converters demonstrating the recommended approach is presented.},

	abstract = {Purpose Life cycle assessment (LCA) is inherently complex and time consuming. The compilation of life cycle inventories (LCI) using a traditional process analysis typically involves the collection of data for dozens to hundreds of individual processes. More comprehensive LCI methods, such as input-output analysis and hybrid analysis can include data for billions of individual transactions or transactions/processes, respectively. While these two methods are known to provide a much more comprehensive overview of a product’s supply chain and related environmental flows, they further compound the complex and time-consuming nature of an LCA. This has limited the uptake of more comprehensive LCI methods, potentially leading to ill-informed environmental decision-making. A more accessible approach for compiling a hybrid LCI is needed to facilitate its wider use.
Methods This study develops a model for streamlining a hybrid LCI by automating various components of the approach. The model is based on the path exchange hybrid analysis method and includes a series of inter-related modules developed using object-oriented programming in Python. Individual modules have been developed for each task involved in compiling a hybrid LCI, including data processing, structural path analysis and path exchange or hybridisation.
Results and discussion The production of plasterboard is used as a case study to demonstrate the application of the automated hybrid model. Australian process and input-output data are used to determine a hybrid embodied greenhouse gas emissions value. Full automation of the node correspondence process, where nodes relating to identical processes across process and input-output data are identified, remains a challenge. This is due to varied dataset coverage, different levels of disaggregation between data sources and lack of detail of activities and coverage for specific processes. However, by automating other aspects of the compilation of a hybrid LCI, the comprehensive supply chain coverage afforded by hybrid analysis is able to be made more accessible to the broader LCA community.
Conclusions This study shows that it is possible to automate various aspects of a hybrid LCI in order to address traditional barriers to its uptake. The object-oriented approach used enables the data or other aspects of the model to be easily updated to contextualise an analysis in order to calculate hybrid values for any environmental flow for any variety of products in any region of the world. This will improve environmental decision-making, critical for addressing the pressing global environmental issues of our time.},

The combination of input–output and physical inventory data on coefﬁcient level is a convenient way of constructing a hybrid LCI that has both good detail and completeness. The proposed approach formalizes how to deal with partially overlapping data in inventory compilation. This particular approach requires that the issue of double counting is resolved in a consistent manner. Algorithms for identifying and adjusting for double counting are developed. Identiﬁcation is performed based on a structural path analysis (SPA). Two algorithms for adjustment are presented. The ﬁrst method is relatively simple to implement but has limitations to its applicability when performing a detailed assessment. The second method is more complex to implement but provides results that allow for more comprehensive structural inventory analysis. Numerical examples are provided in Appendix.},

	abstract = {The life-cycle inventory analysis step of a life-cycle assessment (LCA) may currently suffer from several limitations, mainly concerned with the use of incomplete and unreliable data sources and methods of assessment. Many past LCA studies have used traditional inventory analysis methods, namely process analysis and input–output analysis. More recently, hybrid inventory analysis methods have been developed, combining these two traditional methods in an attempt to minimise their limitations. In light of recent improvements, these hybrid methods need to be compared and validated, as these too have been considered to have several limitations. This paper evaluates a recently developed hybrid inventory analysis method which aims to improve the limitations of previous methods. It was found that the truncation associated with process analysis can be up to 87\%, reﬂecting the considerable shortcomings in the quantity of process data currently available. Capital inputs were found to account for up to 22\% of the total inputs to a particular product. These ﬁndings suggest that current best-practice methods are sufﬁciently accurate for most typical applications, but this is heavily dependant upon data quality and availability. The use of input–output data assists in improving the system boundary completeness of life-cycle inventories. However, the use of input–output analysis alone does not always provide an accurate model for replacing process data. Further improvements in the quantity of process data currently available are needed to increase the reliability of life-cycle inventories. r 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Input–output analysis is one of the central methodological pillars of industrial ecology. However, the literature that discusses different structures of environmental extensions (EEs), that is, the scope of physical flows and their attribution to sectors in the monetary input–output table (MIOT), remains fragmented. This article investigates the conceptual and empirical implications of applying two different but frequently used designs of EEs, using the case of energy accounting, where one represents energy supply while the other energy use in the economy. We derive both extensions from an official energy supply–use dataset and apply them to the same single-region input–output (SRIO) model of Austria, thereby isolating the effect that stems from the decision for the extension design. We also crosscheck the SRIO results with energy footprints from the global multi-regional input–output (GMRIO) dataset EXIOBASE. Our results show that the ranking of footprints of final demand categories (e.g., household and export) is sensitive to the extension design and that product-level results can vary by several orders of magnitude. The GMRIO-based comparison further reveals that for a few countries the supply-extension result can be twice the size of the use-extension footprint (e.g., Australia and Norway). We propose a graph approach to provide a generalized framework to disclosing the design of EEs. We discuss the conceptual differences between the two extension designs by applying analogies to hybrid life-cycle assessment and conclude that our findings are relevant for monitoring of energy efficiency and emission reduction targets and corporate footprint accounting.},

	abstract = {In contrast to macroscopic tools, life cycle assessment (LCA) starts from the microstructure of an economic system: the production and consumption of functional flows. Due to the level of resolution required for function-level details, the model used for LCA has relied on process-specific data and has treated the product system as a stand-alone system instead of a system embedded within a broader economic system. This separation causes various problems, including incompleteness of the system and loss of applicability for a variety of analytical tools developed for LCA or economic models. This study aims to link the functional flow-based, micro-level LCA system to its embedding, commodity-based, meso- or macro-level economic system represented by input – output accounts, resulting in a comprehensive ecological – economic model within a consistent and flexible mathematical framework. For this purpose, the LCA computational structure is reformulated into a functional flow by process framework and reintroduced in the context of the input – output tradition. It is argued that the model presented here overcomes the problem of incompleteness of the system and enables various analytical tools developed for LCA or input –output analysis (IOA) to be utilised for further analysis. The applicability of the model for cleaner production and supply chain management is demonstrated using a simplified product system and structural path analysis as an example.},

In over one third of the literature analysed, authors only refer to their analysis as a hybrid LCI, without naming the actual method used, making it difﬁcult to fully understand which method was used and any potential limitations. Based on the way in which the various hybrid methods are applied and their existing use, the authors propose a set of clear deﬁnitions for existing hybrid LCI methods.

Methods: Following scoping searches, an examination was made of the vocabulary associated with the literature of review and synthesis (literary warrant). A simple analytical framework—Search, AppraisaL, Synthesis and Analysis (SALSA)—was used to examine the main review types.
Results: Fourteen review types and associated methodologies were analysed against the SALSA framework, illustrating the inputs and processes of each review type. A description of the key characteristics is given, together with perceived strengths and weaknesses. A limited number of review types are currently utilized within the health information domain.
Conclusions: Few review types possess prescribed and explicit methodologies and many fall short of being mutually exclusive.

Discussion on allocation among LCA researchers has taken place almost in complete isolation from the series of closely related discussions from the 1960s in the ﬁeld of input−output economics, regarding the supply and use framework. This article aims at developing a coherent mathematical framework for allocation in LCA by connecting the parallel developments of the LCA and the input−output communities. In doing so, the article shows that the partitioning method in LCA is equivalent to the industry-technology model in input−output economics, and system expansion in LCA is equivalent to the by-product-technology model in input−output output economics. Furthermore, we argue that the commodity-technology model and the by-producttechnology model, which have been considered as two different models in input−output economics for more than 40 years, are essentially equivalent when it comes to practical applications. It is shown that the matrix-based approach used for system expansion successfully solves the endless regression problem that has been raised in LCA literature. A numerical example is introduced to demonstrate the use of allocation models. The relationship of these approaches with consequential and attributional LCA models is also discussed.},

This aspect of hybrid LCA is often ignored in reports of hybrid assessments and no comprehensive study has been carried out on it. This article strives to list, compare, and analyze the different existing methods for the correction of double counting. We first harmonize the definitions of the existing correction methods and express them in a common notation, before introducing a streamlined variant. We then compare their respective assumptions and limitations. We discuss the loss of specific information regarding the studied activity/product and the loss of coherent financial representation caused by some of the correction methods. This analysis clarifies which techniques are most applicable to different tasks, from hybridizing individual LCA processes to integrating complete databases.

We surveyed over 450 employees of the University of California, Davis, asking them to choose among hypothetical flight options for university-related business trips. Emissions estimates for flight alternatives were prominently displayed alongside cost, layovers, and airport, and the lowest-emissions flight was labeled ?Greenest Flight.? We found an impressive rate of willingness to pay for lower-emissions flights: around \$200/ton of CO2e saved, a magnitude higher than that seen in carbon offsets programs, and consistent with findings from a prior study with a non-university-based sample. In a second step of analysis, we estimated the carbon and cost impacts if the university were to adopt a flight-search interface that prioritizes carbon emissions information and displays alternatives from multiple regional airports in their employee travel-booking portal. We estimated potential annual savings of 79 tons of CO2e, while reducing airfare costs by \$56,000, mainly through an increased willingness of travelers to take advantage of cheaper nonstop (lower-emissions) flights from a more distant airport in the region over indirect flights from their preferred airport for medium-distance flights. Institutionalizing this strategy within organizations with large travel budgets could reduce personal and organizational carbon footprints. If implemented across major flight-search engines, it could potentially reduce the demand for higher-emissions flights, leading to an industry-wide impact on aviation emissions.},

            With rapidly decreasing purchase prices of electric vehicles, charging costs are becoming ever more important for the diffusion of electric vehicles as required to decarbonize transport. However, the costs of charging electric vehicles in Europe are largely unknown. Here we develop a systematic classification of charging options, gather extensive market data on equipment cost, and employ a levelized cost approach to model charging costs in 30 European countries (European Union 27, Great Britain, Norway, Switzerland) and for 13 different charging options for private passenger transport. The findings demonstrate a large variance of charging costs across countries and charging options, suggesting different policy options to reduce charging costs. A specific analysis on the impacts and relevance of publicly accessible charging station utilization is performed. The results reveal charging costs at these stations to be competitive with fuel costs at typical utilization rates exhibited already today.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          Green hydrogen from renewable electricity and derived e-fuels can replace fossil fuels in applications where direct electrification is infeasible, making them very valuable for climate neutrality. However, here we show that even if electrolysis capacity grows as fast as wind and solar power have, green hydrogen supply remains scarce in the short-term and uncertain in the long-term. Using probabilistic technology diffusion modelling, we find that, despite initial exponential growth, green hydrogen likely (≥75\%) supplies {\textless}1 \% of final energy until 2030 (2035) in the EU (globally). By 2040, a breakthrough is more likely, but large uncertainties prevail with an interquartile range of 4.4-10.5\% (EU) and 1.1-4.3\% (globally). Both short-term scarcity and long-term uncertainty impede investment in hydrogen end-uses and infrastructure, reducing green hydrogen’s potential and jeopardising climate targets. However, historic analogues suggest that emergency-like policy measures could foster substantially higher growth rates, expediting the breakthrough and increasing the likelihood of future hydrogen availability.},

However, the implication of introducing input-output data on the overall uncertainty of an LCA result has been debated. In this study, we selected an existing process LCA, performed a Monte Carlo simulation after hybridizing each truncated ﬂow at a time, and analyzed the dispersion and position of the distribution in the results. The results showed that hybridization eﬀectively moved the mean of the life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 38\% higher while maintaining the standard deviation within the 0.62−0.78 range (relative standard deviation, 3−4\%). We identiﬁed key activities contributing to the overall uncertainty and simulated the potential eﬀect of collecting higher quality supplier-speciﬁc data for those activities on the overall uncertainty. The results showed that replacing as few as 10 of the largest uncertainty contributors with high precision supplier-speciﬁc data substantially narrowed the distribution. Our results suggest that hybridizing truncated inputs improves accuracy of LCA results without compromising their precision, and prioritizing supplierspeciﬁc data collection can further enhance precision in a cost-eﬀective manner.},

	abstract = {Process-based Life Cycle Assessments (PLCA) rely on detailed descriptions of extensive value chains and their associated exchanges with the environment, but major data gaps limit the completeness of these system descriptions and lead to truncations in inventories and underestimations of impacts. Hybrid Life Cycle Assessments (HLCA) aim to combine the strength of PLCA and Environmentally Extended Input Output (EEIO) analysis to obtain more specific and complete system descriptions. Currently, however, most HLCAs only remediate truncation of processes that are specific to each case study (foreground processes), and these processes are then linked to (truncated) generic background processes from a non-hybridized PLCA database. A hybrid PLCA-EEIO database is therefore required to completely solve the truncation problems of PLCA and thus obtain a comprehensive product system coverage. This paper describes the construction of such a database using pyLCAIO, a novel framework and open-source software enabling the streamlined hybridization of entire PLCA and EEIO databases. We applied this framework to the PLCA database Ecoinvent3.5 and the multiregional EEIO database EXIOBASE 3. Thanks to the correction for truncation in this new hybrid database, the median and average life cycle global warming potential (GWP) of its processes increased by 7\% and 14\%, respectively. These corrections only reflect the truncations that could be readily identified and estimated in a semiautomated manner; and we anticipate that further database integration should lead to higher levels of correction in the future.},

The aim was to expand the content of the database, set the foundation for a truly global database, support regionalized LCIA, offer multiple system models, allow for easier integration of data from different regions, and reduce maintenance efforts. This article describes the methodological developments.},

They are LCI computation using process ﬂow diagram; matrix expression of product system; inputeoutput (IO) based LCI; and three diﬀerent forms of hybrid analysis: the tiered hybrid analysis, the IO-based hybrid analysis, and the integrated hybrid analysis. Theory and principles of these methods are presented using a numerical example, and evaluated with regard to data requirements, uncertainty of source data, upstream system boundary, technological system boundary, geographical system boundary, available analytical tools, time and labour intensity, simplicity of application, required computational tools and available software tools. Compliance of these methods to ISO standards is discussed. Finally, conclusions are drawn, combined with a view on the future outlook of these inventory building methods. Ó 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Background: A recent study examining Commercial Claims Insurance database found that many patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) do not remain on their initial TNF inhibitor two years after initiation, particularly women and those taking opioids.
Objectives: To examine factors associated with switching from one TNF inhibitor (i)agent to either another TNFi, IL-17i or JAKi over time (at {\textless}2years and {\textgreater}2 years) in a longitudinal cohort of AS patients.
Methods: Patients enrolled in the Prospective Study of Outcomes in AS (PSOAS), an observational longitudinal study of predictors of AS severity operative since 2002-2020 including over 1250 patients meeting modified New York criteria. Data collected included age, gender, ethnicity, HLA-B27 status, disease activity (BASDAI or ASDAS), erythocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), disease severity,(functional (BASFI) or radiographic (mSASSS)), comorbidities, smoking, exercise, disease duration, depression (either by self report or by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and other medication usage (NSAIDs, including the NSAID index, nonbiologic DMARDs, opioids, anti-depressants, anxiolytics and hypnotics). Logistic regression models were built to identify clinical and sociodemographic characterstics associated with medication switching to another TNFi, IL-17i, or other biologic therapy (another TNFi, Il-17i, or JAKi) within 2 years and after 2 years of initiation).
Results: Of those patients in PSOAS who had at least two years of follow-up, 496 were prescribed anti-TNF, 34 anti-IL-17 and 3 anti-JAK agents. According to the multinomial logistic regression analysis, patients who switched from their original TNFito another TNFi, IL-17i or JAKi within two years after initiating their original TNFi were more likely to be older, have higher baseline subjective disease activity (BASDAI), less radiographic severity by MSASSS, exercise {\textgreater} 120 minutes/week and less likely to be currently smoking. Patients who switched after two years were less likely be depressed, had shorter disease duration, had greater subjective disease activity, were more likely to be exercising {\textgreater} 120 minutes/week, and had more comorbidities.
Conclusion: Different factors were encountered in AS patients who switched from their initial TNFi to another TNFi, IL-17i or JAKi within 2 years versus after 2 years of treatment.},

Methods In the SELECT-AXIS 1 study, adults with active AS and an inadequate response to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs were randomized to receive upadacitinib 15 mg once daily or placebo. At week 14, patients who had been randomized to receive placebo were switched to upadacitinib, and all patients continued in the open-label extension and received upadacitinib up to week 104; interim data up to week 64 are reported herein. Results Of 187 patients, 178 completed week 14 on study drug and entered the open-label extension. Similar proportions of patients in either group (continuous upadacitinib or placebo-to-upadacitinib) achieved Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society 40\% response (ASAS40) or Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) showing low disease activity at week 64: ≥70\% of patients achieved these end points based on nonresponder imputation (NRI) and ≥81\% based on as-observed analyses. Furthermore, ≥34\% (NRI) and ≥39\% (as-observed analysis) achieved ASDAS showing inactive disease or ASAS showing partial remission at week 64. Mean changes from baseline (week 0) to week 64 in pain, function, and inflammation showed consistent improvement or sustained maintenance through the study. Among 182 patients receiving upadacitinib (237.6 patient-years), 618 adverse events (260.1 per 100 patient-years) were reported. No serious infections, major adverse cardiovascular events, venous thromboembolic events, gastrointestinal perforation, or deaths were reported. Conclusion Upadacitinib 15 mg once daily showed sustained and consistent efficacy over 1 year. Patients who switched from placebo to upadacitinib at week 14 showed similar efficacy versus those who received continuous upadacitinib.},

The paper also presents a way to solve this problem, using a set of simultaneous equations with one equation for each unit process and one variable for each product. The authors appear to be unaware of existing approaches towards this problem in which a set of simultaneous equations is used, but with a reverse set-up: one equation for each product and one variable for each unit process. This paper reviews the existing literature and contrasts it with the newly proposed method. It is concluded that the presentation of the new method is unclear in certain parts, and that its realm of application is probably restricted to product systems with mono-functional processes.},

	abstract = {Background, aim, and scope Matrix-based life cycle assessment (LCA) is part of the standard ingredients of modern LCA tools. An important aspect of matrix-based LCA that is straightforward to carry out, but that requires a careful mathematical handling, is the inclusion of sensitivity coefficients based on differentiating the matrix-based formulas. Materials and methods We briefly review the basic equations for LCA and the basic theory of sensitivity coefficients.
Results We present the complete set of sensitivity coefficients from inventory to weighting through characterization and normalization. We show the specific formulas for perturbation analysis, uncertainty analysis, and key issue analysis. We also provide an example using the ecoinvent data. Discussion The limitations of the present approach include the restriction to small changes and uncertainties and the ignorance of correlation between input uncertainties. In contrast to common thinking, there is no restriction to normally distributed uncertainties: Every uncertainty distribution for which a variance can be defined can be submitted to the analytical uncertainty analysis.
Conclusions This paper provides a useful set of tables for a number of purposes related to uncertainty and sensitivity analysis.},

	abstract = {Nearly 30\% of global greenhouse gas emissions are associated with the production of capital goods. Consumption-based emission calculations based on multiregional input−output (MRIO) models allocate emissions occurring in the production of intermediate goods to the ﬁnal goods produced in an economy. Like intermediate goods, capital goods are used in production processes; yet the emissions associated with their production are not allocated to the industries using them. As a result, the carbon footprint of ﬁnal consumption as well as emissions embodied in trade are currently underestimated. Here, we address this problem by endogenizing capital transactions in the EXIOBASE global MRIO database, thereby allocating emissions from capital goods to ﬁnal consumption. We ﬁnd that endogenizing capital substantially increases the carbon footprint of ﬁnal consumption (by up to 57\% for some countries), and that the gap between production-based and consumption-based emissions increases for most countries. We also ﬁnd that the global emissions embodied in trade increase by up to 11\%, and that current patterns of bilaterally traded emissions are ampliﬁed. Furthermore, endogenizing capital leads to a 3-fold increase in the carbon footprint of certain product categories. The results suggest that our approach constitutes an important improvement to current input−output methodology.},

Triglyceride-based liquid fuels have great potential as substitutes for petroleum and its derivatives. To date, the proven technologies for converting triglycerides into biofuels include transesterification, thermal cracking conversion, and hydrogenation. This paper presents an overview of recent research on these conversion technologies, employing homogeneous, heterogeneous, enzymatic, and photocatalytic catalysts. We focus on technical aspects critical to triglyceride conversion, including feedstock analysis, mechanism research, analysis of technological advantages and disad­ vantages, and catalyst development and selection. Biodiesel produced by the transesterification process must be blended with diesel before use due to its higher oxide content. The resultant “green diesel” has a broader range of applications, especially when its structure has been upgraded. Life cycle assessment (LCA) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are reviewed to assess the renewability and sustainability of biofuels. We discuss the typical biodiesel production technologies with their development status, as well as the relevant policies and prospects for biofuels, mainly concerning biodiesel and aviation biofuel.

	abstract = {Abstract
          Hybrid- Life Cycle Assessments (LCA) mostly fails to fully exploit valuable information from Multi-Regional Input-Output (MRIO) models by aggregating regional supply chains to the lower geographical resolution of process LCA databases. We propose a method for sampling the various individual regions within the aggregated regional scope of LCA processes. This sampling not only maximises the information content of the hybrid LCA footprint results by preserving the regional variance, it also allows for using regional price distributions form BACI/UN-COMTRADE international trade statistics to simultaneously improve the accuracy of the hybrid model. In this work we analyse the impact of regional variance and the use of regional price distributions on the uncertainty of the hybrid footprint results for both the carbon (GWP100) and land use footprint and compare this to the variance resulting from price variance only and regional variance only. We find that the median process footprint intensity increases by 7 +18 − 3 \% for the GWP100 due to hybridisation, and 90 +143 − 23 \% for the Land Use footprint. Our results also show that the magnitude of the footprint uncertainty strongly depends on the product sector of the LCA process and environmental impact considered. Additionally, we illustrate the effect of regional variance and price distributions on a consumption footprint using a case study of Swiss household consumption. Here the truncation error estimates are 8 . 4 +9 . 2 − 2 . 7 \% for the GWP100 and 36 +64-14 \% for the land use footprint. The relative uncertainties of the truncation error correction are very high (110-178\% for the upper limits) moreover the have a strong positive skew. Our results highlight the importance of regionalisation of process LCA databases, as it has the potential to significantly improve both the precision and accuracy of hybrid LCA models.},

	abstract = {Hybrid life cycle assessment (HLCA) strives to combine process-based life cycle assessment (PLCA) and environmentally extended input–output (EEIO) analysis to bridge gaps of both methodologies. The recent development of HLCA databases constitutes a major step forward in achieving complete system coverage. Nevertheless, current applications of HLCA still suffer from issues related to incompleteness of the inventory and data gaps: (1) hybridization without endogenizing the capital inputs of the EEIO database leads to underestimations, (2) the unreliability of price data hinders the application of streamlined HLCA for processes in some sectors, and (3) the sparse coverage of pollutants in multiregional EEIO databases limits the application of HLCA to a handful of impact categories. This paper aims at offering a methodology for tackling these issues in a streamlined manner and visualizing their effects on impact scores across an entire PLCA database and multiple impact categories. Data reconciliation algorithms are demonstrated on the PLCA database ecoinvent3.5 and the multiregional EEIO database EXIOBASE3. Instead of performing hybridization solely with annual product requirements, this hybridization approach incorporates endogenized capital requirements, demonstrates a novel hybridization methodology to bypass issues of price unavailability, estimates new pollutants to EXIOBASE3 environmental extensions, and thus yields improved inventories characterized in terms of 13 impact categories from the IMPACT World+ methodology. The effect of hybridization on the impact score of each process of ecoinvent3.5 varied from a few percentages to threefold increases, depending on the impact category and the process studied, displaying in which cases hybridization should be prioritized.

The overall life cycle impacts of several hydrocarbon fuels including kerosene, ethanol, methanol, dimethyl ether, and biodiesel are also studied. The steam methane reforming-based route for hydrogen and ammonia fuels is found to have higher global warming potentials as compared to alternative production routes. High phosphate emissions result in a higher freshwater eutrophication potential for the solar-based route for ammonia fuel. Fossil fuel-based dimethyl ether is found to have a comparatively higher global warming potential of 1.3 kgCO2 equivalent per tonne-km amongst the considered hydrocarbon fuels that include ethanol (1.1 kgCO2 equivalent per tonne-km), kerosene (1.04 kgCO2 equivalent per tonne-km), methanol (1.01 kgCO2 equivalent per tonne-km), and biodiesel (1.07 kgCO2 equivalent per tonne-km). Dimethyl ether is found to entail high toxicity potentials and the reduction of life cycle arsenic, barium, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, and lead emissions is recommended. However, higher photochemical ozone formation potentials of 0.0055 and 0.0046 kgNOx equivalent per tonne-km are associated with biodiesel and kerosene fuels respectively.},

We ﬁrst perform a life cycle assessment of air transport with 72 common aircraft types for diﬀerent ﬂight distances. These results are globally valid. Based on these results, a parameterized model of 5 aircraft size categories is developed that includes variation in aircraft production year, ﬂight distance and maximum seating capacity. Future aircraft improvement is modelled with two scenarios that consider conservative and optimistic assumptions regarding future improvements to aircraft weight, fuel eﬃciency, aerodynamics, and exhaust emissions. In a third step, this model is calibrated to Swiss and European conditions and used to calculate the environmental burdens from Swiss passenger and freight civilian air transport. The model is found to accurately predict national aircraft fuel consumption to within 7\% accuracy over a 25 year period, with the exception of the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of 2001. Results show that, despite signiﬁcant improvements in per passenger kilometer emissions, overall environmental burdens due to air transportation are likely to continue increasing in the future due to rapidly increasing demand. Results further show that as exhaust emissions from aircraft are further reduced, the main cause of many environmental impacts caused by air transport will be due to upstream impacts of kerosene production, and not the direct operating of aircraft.},

	abstract = {A techno-economic analysis of viable scenarios for the aviation industry to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions is presented. These scenarios are based (i) on carbon capture and storage (CCS), where conventional fossil jet fuel is produced, and the corresponding emissions are oﬀset by capturing CO2, either via direct air capture (DAC-CCS route) or via point-source capture (PSC-CCS route), and permanently storing it underground, and (ii) on carbon capture and utilization (CCU), where synthetic jet fuel is produced by using CO2 as feedstock, which is either captured from air (DAC-CCU route) or from a point-source emitter (PSC-CCU route). All routes are feasible and have their advantages and shortcomings. To ensure net-zero CO2 emissions, the feedstock of the point-source emitter, both for CCS- and CCU-based routes, must be of biogenic nature. A quantitative assessment of these scenarios and of a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario, where aviation emissions are subjected to a carbon tax, is performed based on jet fuel cost and carbon price projections until 2050. Cost reductions due to wide deployment and economy of scale of current low-maturity technologies are accounted for. Parametric and Monte Carlo sensitivity analyses are performed to assess the eﬀects of uncertainty associated with the most relevant techno-economic quantities on the observed trends. Findings show that CCS-based scenarios consistently lead to lower jet fuel costs than CCU-based scenarios across the considered time scenarios and sensitivity analyses. This is mainly due to the fact that CCU-based routes result in an energy consumption more than 20 times higher than CCS-based routes, which also implies higher CO2 emissions when considering the carbon intensity of current electricity grids. Overall, the PSC-CCS route represents the most cost-eﬀective solution for decarbonizing the aviation industry, and it is costcompetitive with BAU already today.},

            Alternative aviation fuels possess significant potential to reduce the environmental burdens of the aviation industry. This review critically explores the application of the Life Cycle Assessment Methodology to the assessment of alternative aviation fuels, highlighting critical issues associated with implementing Life Cycle Assessment, such as the regulatory policy, functional unit selection, key system boundaries and the selection of the appropriate allocation methods. Critically distinct from other reviews on aviation fuels, a full, detailed analysis of the 37 Lifecycle Assessment studies currently available is critically evaluated over the past decade, supported by the additional background literature. For the first time, it brings together the assessment of sustainable feedstocks, processes and impact methods on the assessment of the jet fuel fraction. Significantly, the results highlight a lack of assessment into other characterisation factors within the Life Cycle Impact Assessment phase, leading to an over reliance on Global Warming Potentials and high uncertainty during production and combustion of the aircraft at high altitudes. Future perspectives on the next generation of aviation fuels from novel feedstocks are explored, leading to recommendations for applying endpoint damage assessment categories to these studies.},

Two surface structures are stable under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions; a stoichiometric (1 × 1) surface can be prepared by annealing at 450 °C in ≈10−6 mbar O2, and a reduced (2 × 1) reconstruction is formed by UHV annealing at 540 °C. The (1 × 1) surface is close to an ideal bulk termination, and the undercoordinated surface Fe atoms reduce the surface bandgap by ≈0.2 eV with respect to the bulk. The work function is measured to be 5.7 ± 0.2 eV, and the VBM is located 1.5 ± 0.1 eV below EF. The images obtained from the (2 × 1) reconstruction cannot be reconciled with previously proposed models, and a new “alternating trench” structure is proposed based on an ordered removal of lattice oxygen atoms. DFT+U calculations show that this surface is favored in reducing conditions and that 4-fold-coordinated Fe2+ cations at the surface introduce gap states approximately 1 eV below EF. The work function on the (2 × 1) termination is 5.4 ± 0.2 eV.},

	abstract = {Flicker, the temporal modulation of light, is an unwanted eﬀect found in energy eﬃcient light bulbs. It is caused by cheap ballasts, the power supplies that are required for their operation. As energy eﬃcient light bulbs were pushed into consumer’s homes by EU and US energy eﬃciency regulations, it has become a health concern: Flicker has been linked to eyestrain, headaches and migraines. Literature and studies on these eﬀects were widely known by the time the ﬁrst energy eﬃciency legislation was passed. Complex and thus more expensive ballasts have always been able to provide high quality, ﬂicker free light, but were adopted only slowly. When ﬂuorescent lights made their way into consumer’s homes in the early 2000s, regulation was enacted that all but eliminated the ﬂicker caused by their ballasts. When it became clear that LEDs would soon replace their ﬂuorescent counterparts, no legislative action was taken to ensure the same performance standards. Instead, priority was given to lower lamp cost.This resulted in the widespread use of cheap power supplies in LED products released during the past decade. To consumers, the ﬂicker behavior of lamps seemed arbitrary and a general property of LED light bulbs, rather than the result of an inadequate, yet low-cost power supply. This led to reservations about the new technology amongst consumers. The latest EU lighting energy eﬃciency regulation (EU) 2019/2020 ﬁnally made LED based light bulbs ﬂicker free by enacting strict performance limits on ballast performance. The United Kingdom must adopt similar standards or risk seeing all those low-quality light bulbs that cannot be sold on the EU market on store shelves. This policy brief aims to inform about the fundamental cause of ﬂicker in artiﬁcial lighting, its negative eﬀects on wellbeing and considers the drivers of EU legislative response in support of advances in lighting technology.},

	abstract = {With the aim of identifying and quantifying the principal sources of performance improvements and cost reductions in white light emitting diode manufacturing, we collect historical data on device cost and performance, technological breakthroughs and manufacturing innovation for phosphor-converted white light-emitting diodes for the past 20 years. We ﬁnd that technological breakthroughs and process innovation contributed to performance improvements across the entire range of LED device sub-eﬃciencies, resulting in the overall increase in the lamp eﬃciency for the highest performing devices at a test current of 350mA from 5.8\% to 38.7\% between 2002 and 2020. We further develop a bottom-up manufacturing cost model with process-step resolution that captures improvements in throughput, yield and related costs of all relevant manufacturing steps, as well as economies of scale, to analyse progress in LED manufacturing cost structure between early manufacturing in 2002 and mature industry in 2020. We estimate that the cost of manufacturing low-power and mid-power light-emitting diode packages at a US location using state-of-the-art equipment has dropped from 1.11\$(2020) in 2002 to 0.05\$(2020) in 2020, a 95.5\% decrease. We also ﬁnd that the largest contribution to overall cost reduction has come from increase in wafer size, and that in 2020, LED chip packaging is the largest contributor to cost at 60\%.},

	abstract = {Prospective Life Cycle Assessment (pLCA) is useful to evaluate the environmental performance of current and emerging technologies in the future. Yet, as energy systems and industries are rapidly shifting towards cleaner means of production, pLCA requires an inventory database that encapsulates the expected changes in technol­ ogies and the environment at a given point in time, following specific socio-techno-economic pathways. To this end, this study introduces premise, a tool to streamline the generation of prospective inventory databases for pLCA by integrating scenarios generated by Integrated Assessment Models (IAM). More precisely, premise applies a number of transformations on energy-intensive activities found in the inventory database ecoinvent according to projections provided by the IAM. Unsurprisingly, the study shows that, within a given socio-economic narrative, the climate change mitigation target chosen affects the performance of nearly all activities in the database. This is illustrated by focusing on the effects observed on a few activities, such as systems for direct air capture of CO2, lithium-ion batteries, electricity and clinker production as well as freight transport by road, in relation to the applied sector-based transformation and the chosen climate change mitigation target. This work also discusses the limitations and challenges faced when coupling IAM and LCA databases and what improve­ ments are to be brought in to further facilitate the development of pLCA.},

Of the available EE MRIO databases, EXIOBASE stands out as a database compatible with the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA) with a high sectorial detail matched with multiple social and environmental satellite accounts. In this paper, we present the latest developments realized with EXIOBASE 3—a time series of EE MRIO tables ranging from 1995 to 2011 for 44 countries (28 EU member plus 16 major economies) and ﬁve rest of the world regions. EXIOBASE 3 builds upon the previous versions of EXIOBASE by using rectangular supply-use tables (SUTs) in a 163 industry by 200 products classiﬁcation as the main building blocks. In order to capture structural changes, economic developments, as reported by national statistical agencies, were imposed on the available, disaggregated SUTs from EXIOBASE 2. These initial estimates were further reﬁned by incorporating detailed data on energy, agricultural production, resource extraction, and bilateral trade. EXIOBASE 3 inherits the high level of environmental stressor detail from its precursor, with further improvement in the level of detail for resource extraction. To account for the expansion of the European Union (EU), EXIOBASE 3 was developed with the full EU28 country set (including the new member state Croatia). EXIOBASE 3 provides a unique tool for analyzing the dynamics of environmental pressures of economic activities over time.},

Briefly stated, monetary input-output (IO) tables give insight into the value of economic transactions between different sectors in an economy, including output for exports, capital formation and final government and private consumption. They allow for calculating the added value that each sector contributes to the final output of an economy. Such monetary IO tables can be 'extended' with environment-related information for each sector, such as its emissions, primary (natural) resource use, land use and other external effects per sector. These environmental externalities may be expressed in monetary terms as well. The same framework can be used to add other information, for example related to the third pillar of sustainability, regarding social aspects, such as the number and quality of jobs per sector. And, last but not least, such EEIO tables can be integrated in broader models, such as computable general equilibrium (CGE) models.},

	abstract = {Purpose Product systems use the same unit process models to represent distinct but similar activities. This notably applies to activities in cyclic dependency relationships (or Bfeedback loops{\textasciicircum}) that are required an infinite number of times in a product system. The study aims to test the sensitivity of uncertainty results on the assumption made concerning these different instances of the same activities. The default assumption assumes homogeneous production, and the same parameter values are sampled for all instances (e.g., there is one truck). The alternative assumption is that every instance is distinct, and parameter values are independently sampled for different instances of unit processes (e.g., there are infinitely many trucks). Intuitively, sampling the same values for each instance of a unit process should result in more uncertain results.
Methods The results of uncertainty analyses carried out under either assumption are compared. To simulate models where each instance of a unit process is independent, we convert network models to acyclic LCI models (tree models). This is done three times: (1) for a very simple product system, to explain the methodology; (2) for a sample product system from the ecoinvent database, for illustrative purposes; and (3) for thousands of product systems from ecoinvent databases.
Results and discussion The uncertainty of network models is indeed greater than that of corresponding tree models. This is shown mathematically for the analytical approximation method to uncertainty propagation and is observed for Monte Carlo simulations with very large numbers of iterations. However, the magnitude of the difference in indicators of dispersion is, for the ecoinvent product systems, often less than a factor of 1.5. In few extreme cases, indicators of dispersion are different by a factor of 4. Monte Carlo simulations with smaller numbers of iterations sometimes give the opposite result.
Conclusions Given the small magnitude of the difference, we believe that breaking away from the default approach is generally not warranted. Indeed, (1) the alternative approach is not more robust, (2) the current default approach is conservative, and (3) there are more pressing challenges for the LCA community to meet. This being said, the study focused on ecoinvent, which should normally be used as a background database. The difference in dispersion between the two approaches may be important in some contexts, and calculating the uncertainty of tree models as a sensitivity analysis could be useful.},

	abstract = {In the absence of data on the destination industry of international trade flows most multi-regional input–output (MRIO) tables are based on the import proportionality assumption. Under this assumption imported commodities are proportionally distributed over the target sectors (individual industries and final demand categories) of an importing region. Here, we quantify the uncertainty arising from the import proportionality assumption on the four major environmental footprints of the different regions and industries represented in the MRIO database EXIOBASE. We randomise the global import flows by applying an algorithm that randomly assigns imported commodities block-wise to the target sectors of an importing region, while maintaining the trade balance. We find the variability of the national footprints in general below a coefficient of variation (CV) of 4\%, except for the material, water and land footprints of highly trade-dependent and small economies. At the industry level the variability is higher with 25\% of the footprints having a CV above 10\% (carbon footprint), and above 30\% (land, material and water footprint), respectively, with maximum CVs up to 394\%. We provide a list of the variability of the national and industry environmental footprints in the Additional files so that MRIO scholars can check if an industry/region that is important in their study ranks high, so that either the database can be improved through adding more details on bilateral trade, or the uncertainty can be calculated and reported.},

	abstract = {Hybrid Life Cycle Assessment (HLCA) methods attempt to address the limitations regarding process coverage and resolution of the more traditional Process- and Input-Output Life Cycle Assessments (PLCA, IOLCA). Due to the use of different units, HLCA methods rely on commodity price information to convert the physical units used in process inventories to the monetary units commonly used in Input-Output models. However, prices for the same commodity can vary signiﬁcantly between different supply chains, or even between various levels in the same supply chain. The resulting commodity price variance in turn leads to added uncertainty in the hybrid environmental footprint. In this paper we take international trading statistics from BACI/UN-COMTRADE to estimate the variance of commodity prices, and use these in an integrated HLCA model of the process database ecoinvent with the EE-MRIO database EXIOBASE. We show that geographical aggregation of PLCA processes is a signiﬁcant driver in the price variance of their reference products. We analyse the effect of price variance on process carbon footprint intensities (CFIs) and ﬁnd that the CFIs of hybridised processes show a median increase of 6–17\% due to hybridisation, for two different double counting scenarios, and a median uncertainty of −2 to +4\% due to price variance. Furthermore, we illustrate the effect of price variance on the carbon footprint uncertainty in a HLCA study of Swiss household consumption. Although the relative footprint increase due to hybridisation is small to moderate with 8–14\% for two different double counting correction strategies, the uncertainty due to price variability of this contribution to the footprint is very high, with 95\% conﬁdence intervals of (−28, +90\%) and (−23, +68\%) relative to the median. The magnitude and high positive skewness of the uncertainty highlights the importance of taking price variance into account when performing hybrid LCA.},

The impact of these materials is often evaluated through life-cycle assessment (LCA), but there is no clear consensus on how to model the biogenic carbon released or absorbed during their life-cycle. This study investigates and compares existing methods used for biogenic carbon assessment. The most common approaches were identified through an extensive literature review. The possible discrepancies between the results obtained when adopting different methods are made evident through an LCA study of a timber building. Results identified that land-use and land-use-change (LULUC) impacts and carbon-storage credits are not included in most existing methods. In addition, when limiting the system boundary to certain life-cycle stages, methods using the –1/+1 criterion can lead to net negative results for the global warming (GW) score, failing to provide accurate data to inform decision-making. Deviation between the results obtained from different methods was 16\% at the building scale and between 35\% and 200\% at the component scale. Of all the methods studied, the dynamic approach of evaluating biogenic carbon uptake is the most robust and transparent.},

In this phenomenon the off-white mineral turns pink or purple, and the original color can be restored with visible light or heat. For this to happen, there must be traps in the material’s crystal structure, and in hackmanite the traps are chloride vacancies which are sites where a chloride ion should reside, but due to sulfur anions being present, the charge balance does not allow a chloride ion to enter the structure at some point near the sulfur ion. The incident UV photon excites a sulfur atom’s electron which gets trapped in the vacancy. This creates an F center (German Farbzentrum, color center) which absorbs visible light in the green-yellow part (520−540 nm) of the spectrum, causing the coloration of the material. The aim of this study was to gain knowledge on how particle radiation, exposure to Xrays and gamma radiation induce tenebrescence in hackmanites. The theoretical background reviews different types of radiation, current trends in radiation dosimetry and the use of thermoluminescence and optically stimulated luminescence in the ionizing radiation monitoring. Some theory about color spaces and representation models are discussed shortly. Finally, the X-ray analysis techniques used in the experimental section are reviewed. The experimental section focuses on the synthetically prepared hackmanite to gain knowledge on whether the material could be used as a novel application in the field of radiation detection and dosimetry. The section also contains specific instructions on how to make hackmanites and cast them as flexible tapes via the doctor blading method.},

Correlations between the genetic background of spondyloarthritis and inﬂammatory bowel diseases and the inﬂammatory processes involving gut microbiota have been established. This knowledge has allowed progress in pharmacological therapy. The role of diet in the pathogenesis and treatment of diseases pertaining to the HLA-B27 spectrum is of great signiﬁcance, considering possible future applications in individualized medicine. Diet impacts the composition of gut microbiota, representing a substrate for the synthesis of metabolites affecting the mucosal immune system. Certain pro-inﬂammatory mediators, such as emulsiﬁers and microparticles, induce a more profound cytokine response, promoting inﬂammation. Numerous diets, including the low-starch diet, the Mediterranean diet, diets with low contents of fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols (low-FODMAP diets), gluten-free diets and fasting, have been analysed and correlated with patients’ symptomatology and dietary adherence.

The gut–joint axis of inflammation in SpA is further reinforced by similarities in immunopathogenesis at both anatomical sites and by the clinical success of therapies blocking TNF and IL-23 in IBD and in some forms of SpA. Many genetic risk factors are shared between SpA and IBD, and changes in the composition of gut microbiota are seen in both diseases. Current dogma is that inflammation in SpA initiates in the gut and leads to joint inflammation; however, although conceptually attractive, some research does not support this causal relationship. For example, therapies targeting IL-17A are efficacious in the joint but not the gut, and interfering with gut trafficking by targeting molecules such as α4β7 in IBD can lead to onset or flares of SpA. Several important knowledge gaps remain that must be addressed in future studies. Determining the true nature of the gut–joint axis has real-world implications for the treatment of patients with co-incident IBD and SpA and for the repurposing of therapeutics from one disease to the other.},

	abstract = {Subclinical gut inflammation occurring in patients affected by spondyloarthritis (SpA) is correlated with the severity of spine inflammation. Several evidences indicate that dysbiosis occurs in SpA, and that may modulate intestinal permeability and intestinal immune responses. The presence of intestinal dysbiosis is accompanied in SpA patients with the presence of zonulin-dependent alterations of gut-epithelial and gut-vascular barriers. The leakage of epithelial and endothelial surface layers is followed by the translocation of bacterial products, such as lipopolysaccharide and intestinal fatty acid binding protein, in the systemic circulation. These bacterial products may downregulate the expression of CD14 on circulating monocytes leading to an “anergic” phenotype. In the gut, IL-23 may induce the expansion of innate immune cells such as mucosal-associated invariant T cells, γδ T cells, and innate lymphoid cells of group 3 that through the interaction with MAdCAM1 may recirculate form the gut to the sites of SpA active inflammation. On the basis of these findings, gut inflammation observed in SpA patient seems to be not only an epiphenomenon of the on going systemic inflammatory process but may also represent the base camp in which inflammatory cells are activated and from whom they shuttle.},

We conducted a cross-sectional study of axSpA participants meeting the ASAS criteria. Associations between self-reported current alcohol use and disease activity (BASDAI, spinal pain, ASDAS), functional impairment (BASFI), and quality of life were explored using multivariable linear models, adjusting for age, gender, symptom duration, use of TNF inhibition therapy, smoking, deprivation, and anxiety and depression (A\&D). Within alcohol drinkers, effect of increased alcohol intake (defined as {\textgreater} 14 units/week) was explored with moderate drinking (≤ 14 units/week) as reference. The study cohort comprised 229 axSpA patients and 76\% were male with mean age 46.5 years (SD ± 13.8). Alcohol drinking was reported by 64\%, with a median of 6 units per week among drinkers. Compared with non-drinkers, drinkers had lower BASDAI (β = − 0.83; 95\% CI − 1.49, − 0.17), ASDAS (β = − 0.36; 95\% CI − 0.66, − 0.05) and BASFI (β = − 1.40; 95\% CI − 2.12, − 0.68). These associations were in contrast to, and independent of, the detrimental effects of smoking, depression, and deprivation. Subgroup analysis in alcohol drinkers did not reveal significant associations between disease severity and increased alcohol intake. Stratified analyses by smoking revealed that in never-smokers without depression, alcohol was associated with greater reduction in disease activity: BASDAI (β = − 1.69; 95\% CI − 2.93, − 0.45), ASDAS (β = − 0.60; 95\% CI − 1.18, − 0.02). Favourable axSpA disease activity and function were observed in association with alcohol consumption in this cross-sectional study. Longitudinal study is required to explore whether this relationship is due to biological effects of alcohol on disease process or disease-associated behaviour modification.},

Methods: We prospectively collected the information of a group of axSpA patients who were offered nutritional advice for a 6-month period, who were compared to axSpA patients followed at the same center who were not on a specific diet. A nutritionist gave suggestions for dietary modification at baseline and thereafter every 2 months until month 6. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet was evaluated with the PREDIMED questionnaire ranging from 0 (no adherence) to 10 (optimal adherence); disease activity was evaluated with ASDAS-CRP. A multivariable regression analysis was conducted to identify independent predictors of PREDIMED and of ASDAS-CRP improvement (improvement ≥ 20\% of each score).
Results: A total of 161 patients were included: 81 receiving nutritional advice and 80 controls; 47 in the nutritional group and 63 controls had complete information until month 6. Overall, 40 (36.4\%) were females, the mean age was 51.7 ± 1.3 years, and 58 (52.7\%) were affected with psoriasis. No relevant change of anthropometric or laboratory measures was observed in either group. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet was moderate (PREDIMED score 6.7 ± 1.8 at baseline; 7.6 ± 2.1 at month 6) and improved more in the nutritional group compared to controls (p = 0.020). Predictors of a PREDIMED improvement ≥ 20\% were receiving nutritional advice (OR 4.53, 1.36–15.1, p = 0.014), age (per 10-year increase OR 1.05, 1.02–1.68, p = 0.007), and BMI (OR 0.77, 0.63–0.9, p = 0.006). An ASDASCRP improvement ≥ 20\% was more frequent in the nutritional group compared to controls (p = 0.020). A PREDIMED improvement ≥ 20\% was associated with a ASDAS-CRP improvement ≥ 20\% (OR 6.75,1.8–25.3, p = 0.005). Psoriasis and disease duration were negatively but not significantly associated to the ASDAS-CRP improvement.
Conclusions: Improving adherence to the Mediterranean diet may have a beneficial impact on the activity of axSpA. Patients with a lower BMI and older patients are more prone to modify their diet towards the Mediterranean diet following nutritional advice. Patients with psoriasis may have a limited benefit from dietary improvement.},

	abstract = {Introduction
              Subclinical intestinal inflammation and gut dysbiosis have been reported in patients with spondyloarthritis (SpA). In common practice, rheumatologists are increasingly confronted with patients with inflammatory rheumatism who are on gluten-free diets (GFDs), despite the lack of reliable data from controlled studies. This study aims to determine the impact of a GFD on the quality of life of patients with axial SpA.
            
            
              Methods and analysis
              The GlutenSpA study is a 24-week, randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial. Patients with axial SpA (n=200) will follow a 16-week GFD and be randomly assigned (1:1) to an experimental or control arm. In the experimental arm with receive at least 6 gluten-free breads per day + 200 g of gluten-free penne pasta per week + 6 rice flavour capsules per day. The control arm will receive at least 6 gluten-containing breads per day + 200 g of gluten-containing penne pasta per week + 6 vital gluten-containing capsules per day. The primary end-point is the variation in Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society—Health Index (ASAS-HI) questionnaire between week 16 and baseline. A second open-label period of 8 weeks will follow the intervention period, during which the patient will be free to decide whether they will follow the GFD. The secondary outcomes comprise several patient-reported outcomes (SpA activity (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index)), fatigue (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy), depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), functional disability index (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index)), variations in body mass index and Homeostasis Model Assessment Index and variations in the abundance and type of bacterial species found in the gut microbiota for a subgroup of patients (n=40). The data will be analysed using the intention-to-treat principle.
              The regional ethics committee (CPP Nord-ouest IV) has approved the study (IDRCB 2018-A00309-46). The results of the trial will be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals. The authors have no relationship that may have influenced the submitted work.

              , is the most likely triggering factor involved in the initiation and development of these diseases.

	abstract = {Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory arthritis mainly affecting the spinal joints. It would appear that the most likely causative agent in the development of AS is an environmental factor in the genetically susceptible, HLA-B27 positive, individuals. Extensive data from several countries support the notion that Klebsiella pneumonia bacteria are the most likely culprit in the causation of AS. These microbes possess antigens which resemble HLA-B27 and spinal collagens. Increased intake of high-starch diet is directly proportional to the gutassociated bacterial load, especially in the large intestine, and among these microbial agents, Klebsiella is considered as one of the main constituting components. Therefore, a low-starch diet intake alongside the currently used medical therapeutic modalities could be beneficial in the management of patients with early AS. It is suggested that a change in the dietary habits from high protein, low-starch marine components to the Westernized high-starch diet among the Inuit peoples of Alaska and Canada could be considered as one of the main contributing factors in the increased prevalence of AS during the last few decades within this genetically unmixed native population.},

Results: We investigated 207 samples from 103 AS patients and 104 HCs. Alpha diversity was not significant difference in AS compared with HCs. For the community structure, Bacteroidetes was the most represented class. Megamonas, Dorea, and Blautia were significantly greater in AS than in HCs, whereas the abundance of Lachnospira, Ruminococcus, and Clostridium\_XlVb was significantly lower in AS than in HCs. In addition, Specific gut microbiome was significantly correlated with disease activity and dietary factors.
Conclusions: Our results suggest that the human gut microbiome of AS patients was clearly different from that of HCs and bacteria communities are associated with dietary factors and disease activity.},

But there is no satisfactory explanation of why the presence of HLA-B27 predisposes to AS and the precise role played by K. pneumoniae in the disease has not yet been clariﬁed. However, various studies have shown that the results of molecular, immunological, and microbiological studies could establish the link between K. pneumoniae infections and HLA-B27 in the aetiopathogenesis of AS.

Medical History: We present a 33-year-old patient with double-sided HLA B27-positive sacroiliitis, which was diagnosed by magnetic resonance tomography. Since about 10 years he therefore had pain in the iliosacral region. Numerous sessions of physiotherapy, a cure treatment, and treatment with sulfasalazine and doxycycline were not effective. The patient was dependent on the daily intake of the nonsteroidal antirheumatics meloxicam 2 × 7.5 mg and ibuprofen 400 – 800 mg and the analgetic tramadol 50 –150 mg, but evening and night pain and morning stiffness persisted under this treatment. Treatment: We recommended a temporary vegan diet, i.e. to completely avoid animal fats and proteins. Course: 3 – 4 days after changing on vegan diet the complaints improved distinctly and persistently. After consumption of meat 6 weeks later, complaints worsened. Consequent vegan diet again resulted in significant improvement of the pain and morning stiffness. At follow-up 3 months after the initial contact, tramadol and ibuprofen intakes had been stopped, meloxicam had been reduced to 1 × 7.5 mg. The patient was almost completely free of complaints. Conclusions: It was demonstrated that in a single case of sacroilitiis which was refractory to other treatment, vegan diet resulted in a convincingly improvement of complaints.},

            Forecasting is essential to design efforts to address climate change. We conduct a systematic comparison of probabilistic technology cost forecasts produced by expert elicitation and model-based methods. We assess their performance by generating probabilistic cost forecasts of energy technologies rooted at various years in the past and then comparing these with observed costs in 2019. Model-based methods outperformed expert elicitations both in terms of capturing 2019 observed values and producing forecast medians that were closer to the observed values. However, all methods underestimated technological progress in almost all technologies. We also produce 2030 cost forecasts and find that elicitations generally yield narrower uncertainty ranges than model-based methods and that model-based forecasts are lower for more modular technologies.

            We conduct a systematic comparison of technology cost forecasts produced by expert elicitation methods and model-based methods. Our focus is on energy technologies due to their importance for energy and climate policy. We assess the performance of several forecasting methods by generating probabilistic technology cost forecasts rooted at various years in the past and then comparing these with observed costs in 2019. We do this for six technologies for which both observed and elicited data are available. The model-based methods use either deployment (Wright’s law) or time (Moore’s law) to forecast costs. We show that, overall, model-based forecasting methods outperformed elicitation methods. Their 2019 cost forecast ranges contained the observed values much more often than elicitations, and their forecast medians were closer to observed costs. However, all methods underestimated technological progress in almost all technologies, likely as a result of structural change across the energy sector due to widespread policies and social and market forces. We also produce forecasts of 2030 costs using the two types of methods for 10 energy technologies. We find that elicitations generally yield narrower uncertainty ranges than model-based methods. Model-based 2030 forecasts are lower for more modular technologies and higher for less modular ones. Future research should focus on further method development and validation to better reflect structural changes in the market and correlations across technologies.},

We went on to describe general predictions arising from the argument and proposed general laws that manifest the failure of quantum computers.},

	abstract = {While energy statistics report data from a “supply side perspective,” the demand for energy services (incl. “illumination”) drives the need to convert “primary energy” to “useful energy” with the application of “conversion technologies” (Grubler et al., 2014). The availability of detailed reports containing luminous and radiant energy ﬁgures would enable a better assessment of the demand and provide incentives to address ineﬃciencies, for example, due to excessive use of artiﬁcial lighting with no or negligible gains in beneﬁt. For demand focused reporting, technological and methodological challenges need to be overcome. The lack of data concerning, for instance, average end-use conversion eﬃciencies, is often expressed within the literature (Paoli et al., 2018). After synthesizing fundamentals on technical energy eﬃciency from a body of literature related to lighting technologies, and addressing the challenges in linking photometric quantities to derive “electrical to light” conversion eﬃciencies, a historical overview of eﬃciencies is presented for “Best Available White-light Technologies,” including estimations for conversion eﬃciencies. Subsequently, a useful energy analysis is performed for the domestic sector in the UK with modelled data available from the “Department for Business, Energy \& Industrial Strategy” and the application of a calculated time series of conversion eﬃciencies for incandescent, halogen, compact ﬂuorescent and LED lamps for 12 years (2006-2018). The resulting average eﬃciencies stayed way below the state-ofthe-art conversion eﬃciencies of commercially available lighting technologies and evolved from 8.9\% (2006) to 13.5\% (2018) for a “base case” scenario. Finally, a more holistic view of illumination, covering inﬂuences on energy eﬃciency beyond product-based conversion eﬃciencies and eﬃcacies, concludes this work. In closing, an overview of sales volumes and indications for technological diﬀusion is provided for selected regions and countries. Although the replacement of kerosene-based, incandescent, and ﬂuorescent lamps with solid-state-lighting products should be treated with high priority, increasing demand and population growth together with rebound eﬀects may signiﬁcantly diminish the achievable eﬃciency gains. In the end, only a faster transition to low-carbon technologies within the whole energy system (away from fossil fuels), together with appropriate service levels, can mitigate environmental impacts due to CO2 emissions on a global scale.},

	abstract = {Purpose Some LCA software tools use precalculated aggregated datasets because they make LCA calculations much quicker. However, these datasets pose problems for uncertainty analysis. Even when aggregated dataset parameters are expressed as probability distributions, each dataset is sampled independently. This paper explores why independent sampling is incorrect and proposes two techniques to account for dependence in uncertainty analysis. The first is based on an analytical approach, while the other uses precalculated results sampled dependently.
Methods The algorithm for generating arrays of dependently presampled aggregated inventories and their LCA scores is described. These arrays are used to calculate the correlation across all pairs of aggregated datasets in two ecoinvent LCI databases (2.2, 3.3 cutoff). The arrays are also used in the dependently presampled approach. The uncertainty of LCA results is calculated under different assumptions and using four different techniques and compared for two case studies: a simple water bottle LCA and an LCA of burger recipes.
Results and discussion The meta-analysis of two LCI databases shows that there is no single correct approximation of correlation between aggregated datasets. The case studies show that the uncertainty of single-product LCA using aggregated datasets is usually underestimated when the correlation across datasets is ignored and that the magnitude of the underestimation is dependent on the system being analysed and the LCIA method chosen. Comparative LCA results show that independent sampling of aggregated datasets drastically overestimates the uncertainty of comparative metrics. The approach based on dependently presampled results yields results functionally identical to those obtained by Monte Carlo analysis using unit process datasets with a negligible computation time.
Conclusions Independent sampling should not be used for comparative LCA. Moreover, the use of a one-size-fits-all correction factor to correct the calculated variability under independent sampling, as proposed elsewhere, is generally inadequate. The proposed approximate analytical approach is useful to estimate the importance of the covariance of aggregated datasets but not for comparative LCA. The approach based on dependently presampled results provides quick and correct results and has been implemented in EcodEX, a streamlined LCA software used by Nestlé. Dependently presampled results can be used for streamlined LCA software tools. Both presampling and analytical solutions require a preliminary one-time calculation of dependent samples for all aggregated datasets, which could be centrally done by database providers. The dependent presampling approach can be applied to other aspects of the LCA calculation chain.},

In the absence of nuclear war, leaders' expectations of nuclear war and of its control were affected by causal theories and abstract propositions and models which, given their “scientific” and technical nature, were developed by an epistemic community. This study, which emphasizes the roles played by epistemic communities in policy innovation and in the diffusion of understandings across nations and communities, analyzes how the theoretical and practical ideas of the arms control epistemic community became political expectations, were diffused to the Soviet Union, and were ultimately embodied in the 1972 antiballistic missile (ABM) arms control treaty. In contrast to those studies that have concentrated primarily on the workings of international epistemic communities, this study stresses the notion that domestically developed theoretical expectations, which were worked out by a national group of experts and selected by the American government as the basis for negotiations with the Soviets, became the seed of the ABM regime. Moreover, by suggesting that the arms control epistemic community was really an aggregation of several factions that shared common ground against various intellectual and policy rivals, this study sheds light on the question of how much coherence an epistemic community requires. The political selection of new conceptual understandings, followed by their retention and diffusion at national and international levels, suggests an evolutionary approach at odds with explanations of international change advanced by structural realism and approaches based on it.},

            The modern project of creating human-like artificial intelligence (AI) started after World War II, when it was discovered that electronic computers are not just number-crunching machines, but can also manipulate symbols. It is possible to pursue this goal without assuming that machine intelligence is identical to human intelligence. This is known as weak AI. However, many AI researcher have pursued the aim of developing artificial intelligence that is in principle identical to human intelligence, called strong AI. Weak AI is less ambitious than strong AI, and therefore less controversial. However, there are important controversies related to weak AI as well. This paper focuses on the distinction between artificial general intelligence (AGI) and artificial narrow intelligence (ANI). Although AGI may be classified as weak AI, it is close to strong AI because one chief characteristics of human intelligence is its generality. Although AGI is less ambitious than strong AI, there were critics almost from the very beginning. One of the leading critics was the philosopher Hubert Dreyfus, who argued that computers, who have no body, no childhood and no cultural practice, could not acquire intelligence at all. One of Dreyfus’ main arguments was that human knowledge is partly tacit, and therefore cannot be articulated and incorporated in a computer program. However, today one might argue that new approaches to artificial intelligence research have made his arguments obsolete. Deep learning and Big Data are among the latest approaches, and advocates argue that they will be able to realize AGI. A closer look reveals that although development of artificial intelligence for specific purposes (ANI) has been impressive, we have not come much closer to developing artificial general intelligence (AGI). The article further argues that this is in principle impossible, and it revives Hubert Dreyfus’ argument that computers are not in the world.},

	abstract = {Structural decomposition analysis (SDA) is a well-known methodology to assess the relative importance of effects that together constitute the actual change in a variable of interest. A widely recognized problem of SDA is that the results often depend strongly on the speciﬁc decomposition formula chosen, while numerous formulae are equivalent from a theoretical point of view. This ‘non-uniqueness’ problem is often solved rather pragmatically, by reporting an average over (a subset of) all possible formulae. In this paper, we propose an approach that uses maximum entropy econometrics techniques to select a speciﬁc decomposition formula if additional information on one or more (but not all) determinants is available. We illustrate the method empirically by investigating the sources of change in real labour costs by industry in Spain, 1980– 1994.},

	abstract = {Structural decomposition techniques are widely used to break down the growth in some variable into the changes in its determinants. In this paper, we discuss the problems caused by the existence of a multitude of equivalent decomposition forms which are used to measure the contribution of a specijic determinant. Although it is well known that structural decompositions are not unique, the extent of the problem and its consequences seem to have been largely neglected. In an empirical analysisfor The Netherlands between 1986 and 1992, results are calculatedfor 24 equivalent decompositionforms. The outcomes exhibit a large degree of variability across the different forms. We also examine the two approaches that have been used predominantly in the literature. The average of the two so-called polar decompositions appears to be remarkably close to the average of the full set of 24 decompositions. The approximate decomposition with mid-point weights appears to be almost exact. Although this last alternative might seem a solution to the problem of the marked sensitivity, in fact, it only conceals the problem.},

The emitted gravitational waves have the same frequency as the incident electromagnetic waves and are directed along the normal to the reflective surfaces. This papers derives, an equation connecting the radiated gravitational power with the electromagnetic energy injected between reflective plates. The radiated gravitational power can be enhanced and focused on a point using multiple reflective calottes.},

	abstract = {As shown in a previous paper by the authors, the Sonic Double Flutter Aircraft (SDFA) relies on new flight principles - a vibrating permeable surface (VPS) provides both lift and attitude control allowing a streamlined design. SDFA are VTOL aircraft able to achieve unrivaled safety. In addition, SDFA would be able to exceed the efficiency of any other aircraft, easy to operate, inexpensive to manufacture and maintain, i.e., would be practical air-cars. An SDFA has three main components: 1) a wave generator, which generates mechanical power, 2) the VPS, which converts this power into lift with maximum efficiency and also controls attitude and 3) a rigid reflector which allows steady-state VPS operation. The design of circular SDFA is analyzed in detail here. Other configurations are also discussed.},

The data span a wide range (three centuries, six continents, ﬁve lighting technologies, and ﬁve orders of magnitude), and are consistent with a linear variation of percapita consumption of light with the ratio between per-capita gross domestic product and ownership cost of light. No empirical evidence is found for a saturation in per-capita consumption of light, even in contemporary developed nations. Finally, we extrapolate to the world in 2005, and ﬁnd that 0.72 percent (\$437B/year) of world gross domestic product and 6.5 percent (29.5 Quads/year) of world primary energy was used to produce 130 Plmh/year of artiﬁcial light.},
