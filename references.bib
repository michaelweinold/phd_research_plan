	abstract = {The aviation sector has grown at a significant pace in recent years, and despite improvements in aircraft effi­ ciency, the sector’s impact on climate change is a growing concern. To address this concern, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) established the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) to help reduce aviation greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This paper presents a methodology agreed by the 193 ICAO member states to evaluate the life-cycle GHG emissions of sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs), in the CORSIA system. The core life-cycle assessment and induced land use change values of SAFs are presented to determine the GHG savings of certified pathways. The paper aims to present that a number of SAFs can yield significant life-cycle emission reductions compared to petroleum-derived jet fuel. This implies the potentially major role of SAFs in reducing aviation’s carbon footprint.},

	abstract = {Investigations and applications of renewable and sustainable energy have become central for addressing the issue of emissions of greenhouse gases from the use of fossil transportation fuels. Triglyceride-based liquid fuels have great potential as substitutes for petroleum and its derivatives. To date, the proven technologies for converting triglycerides into biofuels include transesterification, thermal cracking conversion, and hydrogenation. This paper presents an overview of recent research on these conversion technologies, employing homogeneous, heterogeneous, enzymatic, and photocatalytic catalysts. We focus on technical aspects critical to triglyceride conversion, including feedstock analysis, mechanism research, analysis of technological advantages and disad­ vantages, and catalyst development and selection. Biodiesel produced by the transesterification process must be blended with diesel before use due to its higher oxide content. The resultant “green diesel” has a broader range of applications, especially when its structure has been upgraded. Life cycle assessment (LCA) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are reviewed to assess the renewability and sustainability of biofuels. We discuss the typical biodiesel production technologies with their development status, as well as the relevant policies and prospects for biofuels, mainly concerning biodiesel and aviation biofuel. It is hoped that our work will be of guiding significance for future biofuel research.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          Hybrid- Life Cycle Assessments (LCA) mostly fails to fully exploit valuable information from Multi-Regional Input-Output (MRIO) models by aggregating regional supply chains to the lower geographical resolution of process LCA databases. We propose a method for sampling the various individual regions within the aggregated regional scope of LCA processes. This sampling not only maximises the information content of the hybrid LCA footprint results by preserving the regional variance, it also allows for using regional price distributions form BACI/UN-COMTRADE international trade statistics to simultaneously improve the accuracy of the hybrid model. In this work we analyse the impact of regional variance and the use of regional price distributions on the uncertainty of the hybrid footprint results for both the carbon (GWP100) and land use footprint and compare this to the variance resulting from price variance only and regional variance only. We find that the median process footprint intensity increases by 7 +18 − 3 \% for the GWP100 due to hybridisation, and 90 +143 − 23 \% for the Land Use footprint. Our results also show that the magnitude of the footprint uncertainty strongly depends on the product sector of the LCA process and environmental impact considered. Additionally, we illustrate the effect of regional variance and price distributions on a consumption footprint using a case study of Swiss household consumption. Here the truncation error estimates are 8 . 4 +9 . 2 − 2 . 7 \% for the GWP100 and 36 +64-14 \% for the land use footprint. The relative uncertainties of the truncation error correction are very high (110-178\% for the upper limits) moreover the have a strong positive skew. Our results highlight the importance of regionalisation of process LCA databases, as it has the potential to significantly improve both the precision and accuracy of hybrid LCA models.},

	abstract = {Process-based life cycle assessments (PLCA) rely on detailed descriptions of extensive value chains and their associated exchanges with the environment, but major data gaps limit the completeness of these system descriptions and lead to truncations in inventories and underestimations of impacts. Hybrid Life Cycle Assessments (HLCA) aim to combine the strength of PLCA and Environmentally Extended Input Output (EEIO) analysis to obtain more specific and complete system descriptions. Currently, however, most HLCAs only remediate truncation of processes that are specific to each case study (foreground processes), and these processes are then linked to (truncated) generic background processes from a non-hybridized PLCA database. A hybrid PLCA-EEIO database is therefore required to completely solve the truncation problems of PLCA and thus obtain a comprehensive product system coverage. This paper describes the construction of such a database using pyLCAIO, a novel framework and open-source software enabling the streamlined hybridization of entire PLCA and EEIO databases. We applied this framework to the PLCA database Ecoinvent3.5 and the multiregional EEIO database, EXIOBASE 3. Thanks to the correction for truncation in this new hybrid database, the median and average lifecycle global warming potential 100 of its processes increased by 7\% and 14\%, respectively. These corrections only reflect the truncations that could be readily identified and estimated in a semi-automated manner; and we anticipate that further database integration should lead to higher levels of correction in the future.},

	abstract = {Hybrid life cycle assessment (HLCA) strives to combine process-based life cycle assessment (PLCA) and environmentally extended input–output (EEIO) analysis to bridge gaps of both methodologies. The recent development of HLCA databases constitutes a major step forward in achieving complete system coverage. Nevertheless, current applications of HLCA still suffer from issues related to incompleteness of the inventory and data gaps: (1) hybridization without endogenizing the capital inputs of the EEIO database leads to underestimations, (2) the unreliability of price data hinders the application of streamlined HLCA for processes in some sectors, and (3) the sparse coverage of pollutants in multiregional EEIO databases limits the application of HLCA to a handful of impact categories. This paper aims at offering a methodology for tackling these issues in a streamlined manner and visualizing their effects on impact scores across an entire PLCA database and multiple impact categories. Data reconciliation algorithms are demonstrated on the PLCA database ecoinvent3.5 and the multiregional EEIO database EXIOBASE3. Instead of performing hybridization solely with annual product requirements, this hybridization approach incorporates endogenized capital requirements, demonstrates a novel hybridization methodology to bypass issues of price unavailability, estimates new pollutants to EXIOBASE3 environmental extensions, and thus yields improved inventories characterized in terms of 13 impact categories from the IMPACT World+ methodology. The effect of hybridization on the impact score of each process of ecoinvent3.5 varied from a few percentages to threefold increases, depending on the impact category and the process studied, displaying in which cases hybridization should be prioritized.

One of the differences is the method used to ensure that mixed LCA and EEIOA data do not overlap, which is referred to as correction for double counting. This aspect of hybrid LCA is often ignored in reports of hybrid assessments and no comprehensive study has been carried out on it. This article strives to list, compare, and analyze the different existing methods for the correction of double counting. We first harmonize the definitions of the existing correction methods and express them in a common notation, before introducing a streamlined variant. We then compare their respective assumptions and limitations. We discuss the loss of specific information regarding the studied activity/product and the loss of coherent financial representation caused by some of the correction methods. This analysis clarifies which techniques are most applicable to different tasks, from hybridizing individual LCA processes to integrating complete databases. We finally conclude by giving recommendations for future hybrid analyses.},

The overall life cycle impacts of several hydrocarbon fuels including kerosene, ethanol, methanol, dimethyl ether, and biodiesel are also studied. The steam methane reforming-based route for hydrogen and ammonia fuels is found to have higher global warming potentials as compared to alternative production routes. High phosphate emissions result in a higher freshwater eutrophication potential for the solar-based route for ammonia fuel. Fossil fuel-based dimethyl ether is found to have a comparatively higher global warming potential of 1.3 kgCO2 equivalent per tonne-km amongst the considered hydrocarbon fuels that include ethanol (1.1 kgCO2 equivalent per tonne-km), kerosene (1.04 kgCO2 equivalent per tonne-km), methanol (1.01 kgCO2 equivalent per tonne-km), and biodiesel (1.07 kgCO2 equivalent per tonne-km). Dimethyl ether is found to entail high toxicity potentials and the reduction of life cycle arsenic, barium, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, and lead emissions is recommended.

            Alternative aviation fuels possess significant potential to reduce the environmental burdens of the aviation industry. This review critically explores the application of the Life Cycle Assessment Methodology to the assessment of alternative aviation fuels, highlighting critical issues associated with implementing Life Cycle Assessment, such as the regulatory policy, functional unit selection, key system boundaries and the selection of the appropriate allocation methods. Critically distinct from other reviews on aviation fuels, a full, detailed analysis of the 37 Lifecycle Assessment studies currently available is critically evaluated over the past decade, supported by the additional background literature. For the first time, it brings together the assessment of sustainable feedstocks, processes and impact methods on the assessment of the jet fuel fraction. Significantly, the results highlight a lack of assessment into other characterisation factors within the Life Cycle Impact Assessment phase, leading to an over reliance on Global Warming Potentials and high uncertainty during production and combustion of the aircraft at high altitudes. Future perspectives on the next generation of aviation fuels from novel feedstocks are explored, leading to recommendations for applying endpoint damage assessment categories to these studies.},

We ﬁrst perform a life cycle assessment of air transport with 72 common aircraft types for diﬀerent ﬂight distances. These results are globally valid. Based on these results, a parameterized model of 5 aircraft size categories is developed that includes variation in aircraft production year, ﬂight distance and maximum seating capacity. Future aircraft improvement is modelled with two scenarios that consider conservative and optimistic assumptions regarding future improvements to aircraft weight, fuel eﬃciency, aerodynamics, and exhaust emissions. In a third step, this model is calibrated to Swiss and European conditions and used to calculate the environmental burdens from Swiss passenger and freight civilian air transport. The model is found to accurately predict national aircraft fuel consumption to within 7\% accuracy over a 25 year period, with the exception of the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of 2001. Results show that, despite signiﬁcant improvements in per passenger kilometer emissions, overall environmental burdens due to air transportation are likely to continue increasing in the future due to rapidly increasing demand. Results further show that as exhaust emissions from aircraft are further reduced, the main cause of many environmental impacts caused by air transport will be due to upstream impacts of kerosene production, and not the direct operating of aircraft.},

	abstract = {A techno-economic analysis of viable scenarios for the aviation industry to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions is presented. These scenarios are based (i) on carbon capture and storage (CCS), where conventional fossil jet fuel is produced, and the corresponding emissions are oﬀset by capturing CO2, either via direct air capture (DAC-CCS route) or via point-source capture (PSC-CCS route), and permanently storing it underground, and (ii) on carbon capture and utilization (CCU), where synthetic jet fuel is produced by using CO2 as feedstock, which is either captured from air (DAC-CCU route) or from a point-source emitter (PSC-CCU route). All routes are feasible and have their advantages and shortcomings. To ensure net-zero CO2 emissions, the feedstock of the point-source emitter, both for CCS- and CCU-based routes, must be of biogenic nature. A quantitative assessment of these scenarios and of a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario, where aviation emissions are subjected to a carbon tax, is performed based on jet fuel cost and carbon price projections until 2050. Cost reductions due to wide deployment and economy of scale of current low-maturity technologies are accounted for. Parametric and Monte Carlo sensitivity analyses are performed to assess the eﬀects of uncertainty associated with the most relevant techno-economic quantities on the observed trends. Findings show that CCS-based scenarios consistently lead to lower jet fuel costs than CCU-based scenarios across the considered time scenarios and sensitivity analyses. This is mainly due to the fact that CCU-based routes result in an energy consumption more than 20 times higher than CCS-based routes, which also implies higher CO2 emissions when considering the carbon intensity of current electricity grids. Overall, the PSC-CCS route represents the most cost-eﬀective solution for decarbonizing the aviation industry, and it is costcompetitive with BAU already today.},

However, it has been argued that the additional economic cost of batteries, emissions occurring during the manufacturing phase of batteries, and emissions caused by losses during the use phase can reduce batteries’ potential in supporting the decarbonization of the electricity sector. Here, we perform a new battery production- and use-phase lifecycle emissions and cost analysis to calculate the additional lifecycle greenhoues gas (GHG) emissions (LCE) and costs (LCC) that arise from storing electricity in six diﬀerent battery technologies, ﬁve applications, and three diﬀerent geographies. Our results show that the LCE of storing electricity are strongly determined by application and geography, whereas LCC vary with application and technology. Lithium-ion technologies perform best across most applications and geographies on both the LCE and LCC dimensions. Furthermore, we only identify trade-oﬀs between the LCC and the GHG emissions cost when assuming a high social cost of GHG emissions of 180 EUR/tonCO2e. Based on our results, we discuss which dimensions of technological improvement of battery technologies are most desirable from a societal perspective.},

Two surface structures are stable under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions; a stoichiometric (1 × 1) surface can be prepared by annealing at 450 °C in ≈10−6 mbar O2, and a reduced (2 × 1) reconstruction is formed by UHV annealing at 540 °C. The (1 × 1) surface is close to an ideal bulk termination, and the undercoordinated surface Fe atoms reduce the surface bandgap by ≈0.2 eV with respect to the bulk. The work function is measured to be 5.7 ± 0.2 eV, and the VBM is located 1.5 ± 0.1 eV below EF. The images obtained from the (2 × 1) reconstruction cannot be reconciled with previously proposed models, and a new “alternating trench” structure is proposed based on an ordered removal of lattice oxygen atoms. DFT+U calculations show that this surface is favored in reducing conditions and that 4-fold-coordinated Fe2+ cations at the surface introduce gap states approximately 1 eV below EF.

	abstract = {Flicker, the temporal modulation of light, is an unwanted eﬀect found in energy eﬃcient light bulbs. It is caused by cheap ballasts, the power supplies that are required for their operation. As energy eﬃcient light bulbs were pushed into consumer’s homes by EU and US energy eﬃciency regulations, it has become a health concern: Flicker has been linked to eyestrain, headaches and migraines. Literature and studies on these eﬀects were widely known by the time the ﬁrst energy eﬃciency legislation was passed. Complex and thus more expensive ballasts have always been able to provide high quality, ﬂicker free light, but were adopted only slowly. When ﬂuorescent lights made their way into consumer’s homes in the early 2000s, regulation was enacted that all but eliminated the ﬂicker caused by their ballasts. When it became clear that LEDs would soon replace their ﬂuorescent counterparts, no legislative action was taken to ensure the same performance standards. Instead, priority was given to lower lamp cost.This resulted in the widespread use of cheap power supplies in LED products released during the past decade. To consumers, the ﬂicker behavior of lamps seemed arbitrary and a general property of LED light bulbs, rather than the result of an inadequate, yet low-cost power supply. This led to reservations about the new technology amongst consumers. The latest EU lighting energy eﬃciency regulation (EU) 2019/2020 ﬁnally made LED based light bulbs ﬂicker free by enacting strict performance limits on ballast performance. The United Kingdom must adopt similar standards or risk seeing all those low-quality light bulbs that cannot be sold on the EU market on store shelves. This policy brief aims to inform about the fundamental cause of ﬂicker in artiﬁcial lighting, its negative eﬀects on wellbeing and considers the drivers of EU legislative response in support of advances in lighting technology.},

	abstract = {With the aim of identifying and quantifying the principal sources of performance improvements and cost reductions in white light emitting diode manufacturing, we collect historical data on device cost and performance, technological breakthroughs and manufacturing innovation for phosphor-converted white light-emitting diodes for the past 20 years. We ﬁnd that technological breakthroughs and process innovation contributed to performance improvements across the entire range of LED device sub-eﬃciencies, resulting in the overall increase in the lamp eﬃciency for the highest performing devices at a test current of 350mA from 5.8\% to 38.7\% between 2002 and 2020. We further develop a bottom-up manufacturing cost model with process-step resolution that captures improvements in throughput, yield and related costs of all relevant manufacturing steps, as well as economies of scale, to analyse progress in LED manufacturing cost structure between early manufacturing in 2002 and mature industry in 2020. We estimate that the cost of manufacturing low-power and mid-power light-emitting diode packages at a US location using state-of-the-art equipment has dropped from 1.11\$(2020) in 2002 to 0.05\$(2020) in 2020, a 95.5\% decrease. We also ﬁnd that the largest contribution to overall cost reduction has come from increase in wafer size, and that in 2020, LED chip packaging is the largest contributor to cost at 60\%.},

	abstract = {Prospective Life Cycle Assessment (pLCA) is useful to evaluate the environmental performance of current and emerging technologies in the future. Yet, as energy systems and industries are rapidly shifting towards cleaner means of production, pLCA requires an inventory database that encapsulates the expected changes in technol­ ogies and the environment at a given point in time, following specific socio-techno-economic pathways. To this end, this study introduces premise, a tool to streamline the generation of prospective inventory databases for pLCA by integrating scenarios generated by Integrated Assessment Models (IAM). More precisely, premise applies a number of transformations on energy-intensive activities found in the inventory database ecoinvent according to projections provided by the IAM. Unsurprisingly, the study shows that, within a given socio-economic narrative, the climate change mitigation target chosen affects the performance of nearly all activities in the database. This is illustrated by focusing on the effects observed on a few activities, such as systems for direct air capture of CO2, lithium-ion batteries, electricity and clinker production as well as freight transport by road, in relation to the applied sector-based transformation and the chosen climate change mitigation target. This work also discusses the limitations and challenges faced when coupling IAM and LCA databases and what improve­ ments are to be brought in to further facilitate the development of pLCA.},

Of the available EE MRIO databases, EXIOBASE stands out as a database compatible with the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA) with a high sectorial detail matched with multiple social and environmental satellite accounts. In this paper, we present the latest developments realized with EXIOBASE 3—a time series of EE MRIO tables ranging from 1995 to 2011 for 44 countries (28 EU member plus 16 major economies) and ﬁve rest of the world regions. EXIOBASE 3 builds upon the previous versions of EXIOBASE by using rectangular supply-use tables (SUTs) in a 163 industry by 200 products classiﬁcation as the main building blocks. In order to capture structural changes, economic developments, as reported by national statistical agencies, were imposed on the available, disaggregated SUTs from EXIOBASE 2. These initial estimates were further reﬁned by incorporating detailed data on energy, agricultural production, resource extraction, and bilateral trade. EXIOBASE 3 inherits the high level of environmental stressor detail from its precursor, with further improvement in the level of detail for resource extraction. To account for the expansion of the European Union (EU), EXIOBASE 3 was developed with the full EU28 country set (including the new member state Croatia). EXIOBASE 3 provides a unique tool for analyzing the dynamics of environmental pressures of economic activities over time.},

	abstract = {Environmentally extended input-output (EEIO) tables and models have become a powerful element in supporting information-based environmental and economic policies. Briefly stated, monetary input-output (IO) tables give insight into the value of economic transactions between different sectors in an economy, including output for exports, capital formation and final government and private consumption. They allow for calculating the added value that each sector contributes to the final output of an economy. Such monetary IO tables can be 'extended' with environment-related information for each sector, such as its emissions, primary (natural) resource use, land use and other external effects per sector. These environmental externalities may be expressed in monetary terms as well. The same framework can be used to add other information, for example related to the third pillar of sustainability, regarding social aspects, such as the number and quality of jobs per sector. And, last but not least, such EEIO tables can be integrated in broader models, such as computable general equilibrium (CGE) models.},

	abstract = {Purpose Product systems use the same unit process models to represent distinct but similar activities. This notably applies to activities in cyclic dependency relationships (or Bfeedback loops{\textasciicircum}) that are required an infinite number of times in a product system. The study aims to test the sensitivity of uncertainty results on the assumption made concerning these different instances of the same activities. The default assumption assumes homogeneous production, and the same parameter values are sampled for all instances (e.g., there is one truck). The alternative assumption is that every instance is distinct, and parameter values are independently sampled for different instances of unit processes (e.g., there are infinitely many trucks). Intuitively, sampling the same values for each instance of a unit process should result in more uncertain results.
Methods The results of uncertainty analyses carried out under either assumption are compared. To simulate models where each instance of a unit process is independent, we convert network models to acyclic LCI models (tree models). This is done three times: (1) for a very simple product system, to explain the methodology; (2) for a sample product system from the ecoinvent database, for illustrative purposes; and (3) for thousands of product systems from ecoinvent databases.
Results and discussion The uncertainty of network models is indeed greater than that of corresponding tree models. This is shown mathematically for the analytical approximation method to uncertainty propagation and is observed for Monte Carlo simulations with very large numbers of iterations. However, the magnitude of the difference in indicators of dispersion is, for the ecoinvent product systems, often less than a factor of 1.5. In few extreme cases, indicators of dispersion are different by a factor of 4. Monte Carlo simulations with smaller numbers of iterations sometimes give the opposite result.
Conclusions Given the small magnitude of the difference, we believe that breaking away from the default approach is generally not warranted. Indeed, (1) the alternative approach is not more robust, (2) the current default approach is conservative, and (3) there are more pressing challenges for the LCA community to meet. This being said, the study focused on ecoinvent, which should normally be used as a background database. The difference in dispersion between the two approaches may be important in some contexts, and calculating the uncertainty of tree models as a sensitivity analysis could be useful.},

	abstract = {In the absence of data on the destination industry of international trade flows most multi-regional input–output (MRIO) tables are based on the import proportionality assumption. Under this assumption imported commodities are proportionally distributed over the target sectors (individual industries and final demand categories) of an importing region. Here, we quantify the uncertainty arising from the import proportionality assumption on the four major environmental footprints of the different regions and industries represented in the MRIO database EXIOBASE. We randomise the global import flows by applying an algorithm that randomly assigns imported commodities block-wise to the target sectors of an importing region, while maintaining the trade balance. We find the variability of the national footprints in general below a coefficient of variation (CV) of 4\%, except for the material, water and land footprints of highly trade-dependent and small economies. At the industry level the variability is higher with 25\% of the footprints having a CV above 10\% (carbon footprint), and above 30\% (land, material and water footprint), respectively, with maximum CVs up to 394\%. We provide a list of the variability of the national and industry environmental footprints in the Additional files so that MRIO scholars can check if an industry/region that is important in their study ranks high, so that either the database can be improved through adding more details on bilateral trade, or the uncertainty can be calculated and reported.},

	abstract = {Hybrid Life Cycle Assessment (HLCA) methods attempt to address the limitations regarding process coverage and resolution of the more traditional Process- and Input-Output Life Cycle Assessments (PLCA, IOLCA). Due to the use of different units, HLCA methods rely on commodity price information to convert the physical units used in process inventories to the monetary units commonly used in Input-Output models. However, prices for the same commodity can vary signiﬁcantly between different supply chains, or even between various levels in the same supply chain. The resulting commodity price variance in turn leads to added uncertainty in the hybrid environmental footprint. In this paper we take international trading statistics from BACI/UN-COMTRADE to estimate the variance of commodity prices, and use these in an integrated HLCA model of the process database ecoinvent with the EE-MRIO database EXIOBASE. We show that geographical aggregation of PLCA processes is a signiﬁcant driver in the price variance of their reference products. We analyse the effect of price variance on process carbon footprint intensities (CFIs) and ﬁnd that the CFIs of hybridised processes show a median increase of 6–17\% due to hybridisation, for two different double counting scenarios, and a median uncertainty of −2 to +4\% due to price variance. Furthermore, we illustrate the effect of price variance on the carbon footprint uncertainty in a HLCA study of Swiss household consumption. Although the relative footprint increase due to hybridisation is small to moderate with 8–14\% for two different double counting correction strategies, the uncertainty due to price variability of this contribution to the footprint is very high, with 95\% conﬁdence intervals of (−28, +90\%) and (−23, +68\%) relative to the median. The magnitude and high positive skewness of the uncertainty highlights the importance of taking price variance into account when performing hybrid LCA.},

The impact of these materials is often evaluated through life-cycle assessment (LCA), but there is no clear consensus on how to model the biogenic carbon released or absorbed during their life-cycle. This study investigates and compares existing methods used for biogenic carbon assessment. The most common approaches were identified through an extensive literature review. The possible discrepancies between the results obtained when adopting different methods are made evident through an LCA study of a timber building. Results identified that land-use and land-use-change (LULUC) impacts and carbon-storage credits are not included in most existing methods. In addition, when limiting the system boundary to certain life-cycle stages, methods using the –1/+1 criterion can lead to net negative results for the global warming (GW) score, failing to provide accurate data to inform decision-making. Deviation between the results obtained from different methods was 16\% at the building scale and between 35\% and 200\% at the component scale. Of all the methods studied, the dynamic approach of evaluating biogenic carbon uptake is the most robust and transparent.},

In this phenomenon the off-white mineral turns pink or purple, and the original color can be restored with visible light or heat. For this to happen, there must be traps in the material’s crystal structure, and in hackmanite the traps are chloride vacancies which are sites where a chloride ion should reside, but due to sulfur anions being present, the charge balance does not allow a chloride ion to enter the structure at some point near the sulfur ion. The incident UV photon excites a sulfur atom’s electron which gets trapped in the vacancy. This creates an F center (German Farbzentrum, color center) which absorbs visible light in the green-yellow part (520−540 nm) of the spectrum, causing the coloration of the material. The aim of this study was to gain knowledge on how particle radiation, exposure to Xrays and gamma radiation induce tenebrescence in hackmanites. The theoretical background reviews different types of radiation, current trends in radiation dosimetry and the use of thermoluminescence and optically stimulated luminescence in the ionizing radiation monitoring. Some theory about color spaces and representation models are discussed shortly. Finally, the X-ray analysis techniques used in the experimental section are reviewed. The experimental section focuses on the synthetically prepared hackmanite to gain knowledge on whether the material could be used as a novel application in the field of radiation detection and dosimetry. The section also contains specific instructions on how to make hackmanites and cast them as flexible tapes via the doctor blading method.},

Certain pro-inﬂammatory mediators, such as emulsiﬁers and microparticles, induce a more profound cytokine response, promoting inﬂammation. Numerous diets, including the low-starch diet, the Mediterranean diet, diets with low contents of fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols (low-FODMAP diets), gluten-free diets and fasting, have been analysed and correlated with patients’ symptomatology and dietary adherence. The aim of this review is to provide an extensive perspective on the diets available to patients with spondyloarthritis and related immune-mediated disorders.},

	abstract = {Gut inflammation is strongly associated with spondyloarthritis (SpA), as exemplified by the high prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and the even higher occurrence of subclinical gut inflammation in patients with SpA. The gut–joint axis of inflammation in SpA is further reinforced by similarities in immunopathogenesis at both anatomical sites and by the clinical success of therapies blocking TNF and IL-23 in IBD and in some forms of SpA. Many genetic risk factors are shared between SpA and IBD, and changes in the composition of gut microbiota are seen in both diseases. Current dogma is that inflammation in SpA initiates in the gut and leads to joint inflammation; however, although conceptually attractive, some research does not support this causal relationship. For example, therapies targeting IL-17A are efficacious in the joint but not the gut, and interfering with gut trafficking by targeting molecules such as α4β7 in IBD can lead to onset or flares of SpA. Several important knowledge gaps remain that must be addressed in future studies. Determining the true nature of the gut–joint axis has real-world implications for the treatment of patients with co-incident IBD and SpA and for the repurposing of therapeutics from one disease to the other.},

	abstract = {Subclinical gut inflammation occurring in patients affected by spondyloarthritis (SpA) is correlated with the severity of spine inflammation. Several evidences indicate that dysbiosis occurs in SpA, and that may modulate intestinal permeability and intestinal immune responses. The presence of intestinal dysbiosis is accompanied in SpA patients with the presence of zonulin-dependent alterations of gut-epithelial and gut-vascular barriers. The leakage of epithelial and endothelial surface layers is followed by the translocation of bacterial products, such as lipopolysaccharide and intestinal fatty acid binding protein, in the systemic circulation. These bacterial products may downregulate the expression of CD14 on circulating monocytes leading to an “anergic” phenotype. In the gut, IL-23 may induce the expansion of innate immune cells such as mucosal-associated invariant T cells, γδ T cells, and innate lymphoid cells of group 3 that through the interaction with MAdCAM1 may recirculate form the gut to the sites of SpA active inflammation. On the basis of these findings, gut inflammation observed in SpA patient seems to be not only an epiphenomenon of the on going systemic inflammatory process but may also represent the base camp in which inflammatory cells are activated and from whom they shuttle.},

We conducted a cross-sectional study of axSpA participants meeting the ASAS criteria. Associations between self-reported current alcohol use and disease activity (BASDAI, spinal pain, ASDAS), functional impairment (BASFI), and quality of life were explored using multivariable linear models, adjusting for age, gender, symptom duration, use of TNF inhibition therapy, smoking, deprivation, and anxiety and depression (A\&D). Within alcohol drinkers, effect of increased alcohol intake (defined as {\textgreater} 14 units/week) was explored with moderate drinking (≤ 14 units/week) as reference. The study cohort comprised 229 axSpA patients and 76\% were male with mean age 46.5 years (SD ± 13.8). Alcohol drinking was reported by 64\%, with a median of 6 units per week among drinkers. Compared with non-drinkers, drinkers had lower BASDAI (β = − 0.83; 95\% CI − 1.49, − 0.17), ASDAS (β = − 0.36; 95\% CI − 0.66, − 0.05) and BASFI (β = − 1.40; 95\% CI − 2.12, − 0.68). These associations were in contrast to, and independent of, the detrimental effects of smoking, depression, and deprivation. Subgroup analysis in alcohol drinkers did not reveal significant associations between disease severity and increased alcohol intake. Stratified analyses by smoking revealed that in never-smokers without depression, alcohol was associated with greater reduction in disease activity: BASDAI (β = − 1.69; 95\% CI − 2.93, − 0.45), ASDAS (β = − 0.60; 95\% CI − 1.18, − 0.02). Favourable axSpA disease activity and function were observed in association with alcohol consumption in this cross-sectional study. Longitudinal study is required to explore whether this relationship is due to biological effects of alcohol on disease process or disease-associated behaviour modification.},

Methods: We prospectively collected the information of a group of axSpA patients who were offered nutritional advice for a 6-month period, who were compared to axSpA patients followed at the same center who were not on a specific diet. A nutritionist gave suggestions for dietary modification at baseline and thereafter every 2 months until month 6. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet was evaluated with the PREDIMED questionnaire ranging from 0 (no adherence) to 10 (optimal adherence); disease activity was evaluated with ASDAS-CRP. A multivariable regression analysis was conducted to identify independent predictors of PREDIMED and of ASDAS-CRP improvement (improvement ≥ 20\% of each score).
Results: A total of 161 patients were included: 81 receiving nutritional advice and 80 controls; 47 in the nutritional group and 63 controls had complete information until month 6. Overall, 40 (36.4\%) were females, the mean age was 51.7 ± 1.3 years, and 58 (52.7\%) were affected with psoriasis. No relevant change of anthropometric or laboratory measures was observed in either group. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet was moderate (PREDIMED score 6.7 ± 1.8 at baseline; 7.6 ± 2.1 at month 6) and improved more in the nutritional group compared to controls (p = 0.020). Predictors of a PREDIMED improvement ≥ 20\% were receiving nutritional advice (OR 4.53, 1.36–15.1, p = 0.014), age (per 10-year increase OR 1.05, 1.02–1.68, p = 0.007), and BMI (OR 0.77, 0.63–0.9, p = 0.006). An ASDASCRP improvement ≥ 20\% was more frequent in the nutritional group compared to controls (p = 0.020). A PREDIMED improvement ≥ 20\% was associated with a ASDAS-CRP improvement ≥ 20\% (OR 6.75,1.8–25.3, p = 0.005). Psoriasis and disease duration were negatively but not significantly associated to the ASDAS-CRP improvement.
Conclusions: Improving adherence to the Mediterranean diet may have a beneficial impact on the activity of axSpA. Patients with a lower BMI and older patients are more prone to modify their diet towards the Mediterranean diet following nutritional advice. Patients with psoriasis may have a limited benefit from dietary improvement.},

	abstract = {Introduction
              Subclinical intestinal inflammation and gut dysbiosis have been reported in patients with spondyloarthritis (SpA). In common practice, rheumatologists are increasingly confronted with patients with inflammatory rheumatism who are on gluten-free diets (GFDs), despite the lack of reliable data from controlled studies. This study aims to determine the impact of a GFD on the quality of life of patients with axial SpA.
            
            
              Methods and analysis
              The GlutenSpA study is a 24-week, randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial. Patients with axial SpA (n=200) will follow a 16-week GFD and be randomly assigned (1:1) to an experimental or control arm. In the experimental arm with receive at least 6 gluten-free breads per day + 200 g of gluten-free penne pasta per week + 6 rice flavour capsules per day. The control arm will receive at least 6 gluten-containing breads per day + 200 g of gluten-containing penne pasta per week + 6 vital gluten-containing capsules per day. The primary end-point is the variation in Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society—Health Index (ASAS-HI) questionnaire between week 16 and baseline. A second open-label period of 8 weeks will follow the intervention period, during which the patient will be free to decide whether they will follow the GFD. The secondary outcomes comprise several patient-reported outcomes (SpA activity (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index)), fatigue (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy), depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), functional disability index (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index)), variations in body mass index and Homeostasis Model Assessment Index and variations in the abundance and type of bacterial species found in the gut microbiota for a subgroup of patients (n=40). The data will be analysed using the intention-to-treat principle.
              The regional ethics committee (CPP Nord-ouest IV) has approved the study (IDRCB 2018-A00309-46). The results of the trial will be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals. The authors have no relationship that may have influenced the submitted work.

	abstract = {Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory arthritis mainly affecting the spinal joints. It would appear that the most likely causative agent in the development of AS is an environmental factor in the genetically susceptible, HLA-B27 positive, individuals. Extensive data from several countries support the notion that Klebsiella pneumonia bacteria are the most likely culprit in the causation of AS. These microbes possess antigens which resemble HLA-B27 and spinal collagens. Increased intake of high-starch diet is directly proportional to the gutassociated bacterial load, especially in the large intestine, and among these microbial agents, Klebsiella is considered as one of the main constituting components. Therefore, a low-starch diet intake alongside the currently used medical therapeutic modalities could be beneficial in the management of patients with early AS. It is suggested that a change in the dietary habits from high protein, low-starch marine components to the Westernized high-starch diet among the Inuit peoples of Alaska and Canada could be considered as one of the main contributing factors in the increased prevalence of AS during the last few decades within this genetically unmixed native population.},

Alpha and beta diversities were assessed using QIIME, and comparisons were performed using one-way ANOVA, Student's t-test, and SKN multiple range comparisons to examine differences between groups and a correlation network analysis was performed.
Results: We investigated 207 samples from 103 AS patients and 104 HCs. Alpha diversity was not significant difference in AS compared with HCs. For the community structure, Bacteroidetes was the most represented class. Megamonas, Dorea, and Blautia were significantly greater in AS than in HCs, whereas the abundance of Lachnospira, Ruminococcus, and Clostridium\_XlVb was significantly lower in AS than in HCs. In addition, Specific gut microbiome was significantly correlated with disease activity and dietary factors.
Conclusions: Our results suggest that the human gut microbiome of AS patients was clearly different from that of HCs and bacteria communities are associated with dietary factors and disease activity.},

But there is no satisfactory explanation of why the presence of HLA-B27 predisposes to AS and the precise role played by K. pneumoniae in the disease has not yet been clariﬁed. However, various studies have shown that the results of molecular, immunological, and microbiological studies could establish the link between K. pneumoniae infections and HLA-B27 in the aetiopathogenesis of AS.

Extensive literature based on the results of various genetic, microbiological, molecular and immunological studies carried out by independent research groups suggests that Klebsiella pneumoniae is the main microbial agent being implicated as a triggering and/or perpetuating factor in the etiopathogenesis of AS. Novel diagnostic markers and criteria based on the association with high antiKlebsiella antibodies could be used in the detection of AS patients during early stages of the disease, and together with the current treatments might help in implementing the use of new therapeutic anti-microbial measures in the management of AS. Prospective longitudinal studies with the use of anti-microbial measures in patients with AS are required to establish the therapeutic benefit of this microbe–disease association.},

Medical History: We present a 33-year-old patient with double-sided HLA B27-positive sacroiliitis, which was diagnosed by magnetic resonance tomography. Since about 10 years he therefore had pain in the iliosacral region. Numerous sessions of physiotherapy, a cure treatment, and treatment with sulfasalazine and doxycycline were not effective. The patient was dependent on the daily intake of the nonsteroidal antirheumatics meloxicam 2 × 7.5 mg and ibuprofen 400 – 800 mg and the analgetic tramadol 50 –150 mg, but evening and night pain and morning stiffness persisted under this treatment. Treatment: We recommended a temporary vegan diet, i.e. to completely avoid animal fats and proteins. Course: 3 – 4 days after changing on vegan diet the complaints improved distinctly and persistently. After consumption of meat 6 weeks later, complaints worsened. Consequent vegan diet again resulted in significant improvement of the pain and morning stiffness. At follow-up 3 months after the initial contact, tramadol and ibuprofen intakes had been stopped, meloxicam had been reduced to 1 × 7.5 mg. The patient was almost completely free of complaints. Conclusions: It was demonstrated that in a single case of sacroilitiis which was refractory to other treatment, vegan diet resulted in a convincingly improvement of complaints.},

            Forecasting is essential to design efforts to address climate change. We conduct a systematic comparison of probabilistic technology cost forecasts produced by expert elicitation and model-based methods. We assess their performance by generating probabilistic cost forecasts of energy technologies rooted at various years in the past and then comparing these with observed costs in 2019. Model-based methods outperformed expert elicitations both in terms of capturing 2019 observed values and producing forecast medians that were closer to the observed values. However, all methods underestimated technological progress in almost all technologies. We also produce 2030 cost forecasts and find that elicitations generally yield narrower uncertainty ranges than model-based methods and that model-based forecasts are lower for more modular technologies.

            We conduct a systematic comparison of technology cost forecasts produced by expert elicitation methods and model-based methods. Our focus is on energy technologies due to their importance for energy and climate policy. We assess the performance of several forecasting methods by generating probabilistic technology cost forecasts rooted at various years in the past and then comparing these with observed costs in 2019. We do this for six technologies for which both observed and elicited data are available. The model-based methods use either deployment (Wright’s law) or time (Moore’s law) to forecast costs. We show that, overall, model-based forecasting methods outperformed elicitation methods. Their 2019 cost forecast ranges contained the observed values much more often than elicitations, and their forecast medians were closer to observed costs. However, all methods underestimated technological progress in almost all technologies, likely as a result of structural change across the energy sector due to widespread policies and social and market forces. We also produce forecasts of 2030 costs using the two types of methods for 10 energy technologies. We find that elicitations generally yield narrower uncertainty ranges than model-based methods. Model-based 2030 forecasts are lower for more modular technologies and higher for less modular ones. Future research should focus on further method development and validation to better reflect structural changes in the market and correlations across technologies.},

We went on to describe general predictions arising from the argument and proposed general laws that manifest the failure of quantum computers.},

	abstract = {While energy statistics report data from a “supply side perspective,” the demand for energy services (incl. “illumination”) drives the need to convert “primary energy” to “useful energy” with the application of “conversion technologies” (Grubler et al., 2014). The availability of detailed reports containing luminous and radiant energy ﬁgures would enable a better assessment of the demand and provide incentives to address ineﬃciencies, for example, due to excessive use of artiﬁcial lighting with no or negligible gains in beneﬁt. For demand focused reporting, technological and methodological challenges need to be overcome. The lack of data concerning, for instance, average end-use conversion eﬃciencies, is often expressed within the literature (Paoli et al., 2018). After synthesizing fundamentals on technical energy eﬃciency from a body of literature related to lighting technologies, and addressing the challenges in linking photometric quantities to derive “electrical to light” conversion eﬃciencies, a historical overview of eﬃciencies is presented for “Best Available White-light Technologies,” including estimations for conversion eﬃciencies. Subsequently, a useful energy analysis is performed for the domestic sector in the UK with modelled data available from the “Department for Business, Energy \& Industrial Strategy” and the application of a calculated time series of conversion eﬃciencies for incandescent, halogen, compact ﬂuorescent and LED lamps for 12 years (2006-2018). The resulting average eﬃciencies stayed way below the state-ofthe-art conversion eﬃciencies of commercially available lighting technologies and evolved from 8.9\% (2006) to 13.5\% (2018) for a “base case” scenario. Finally, a more holistic view of illumination, covering inﬂuences on energy eﬃciency beyond product-based conversion eﬃciencies and eﬃcacies, concludes this work. In closing, an overview of sales volumes and indications for technological diﬀusion is provided for selected regions and countries. Although the replacement of kerosene-based, incandescent, and ﬂuorescent lamps with solid-state-lighting products should be treated with high priority, increasing demand and population growth together with rebound eﬀects may signiﬁcantly diminish the achievable eﬃciency gains. In the end, only a faster transition to low-carbon technologies within the whole energy system (away from fossil fuels), together with appropriate service levels, can mitigate environmental impacts due to CO2 emissions on a global scale.},

	abstract = {Purpose Some LCA software tools use precalculated aggregated datasets because they make LCA calculations much quicker. However, these datasets pose problems for uncertainty analysis. Even when aggregated dataset parameters are expressed as probability distributions, each dataset is sampled independently. This paper explores why independent sampling is incorrect and proposes two techniques to account for dependence in uncertainty analysis. The first is based on an analytical approach, while the other uses precalculated results sampled dependently.
Methods The algorithm for generating arrays of dependently presampled aggregated inventories and their LCA scores is described. These arrays are used to calculate the correlation across all pairs of aggregated datasets in two ecoinvent LCI databases (2.2, 3.3 cutoff). The arrays are also used in the dependently presampled approach. The uncertainty of LCA results is calculated under different assumptions and using four different techniques and compared for two case studies: a simple water bottle LCA and an LCA of burger recipes.
Results and discussion The meta-analysis of two LCI databases shows that there is no single correct approximation of correlation between aggregated datasets. The case studies show that the uncertainty of single-product LCA using aggregated datasets is usually underestimated when the correlation across datasets is ignored and that the magnitude of the underestimation is dependent on the system being analysed and the LCIA method chosen. Comparative LCA results show that independent sampling of aggregated datasets drastically overestimates the uncertainty of comparative metrics. The approach based on dependently presampled results yields results functionally identical to those obtained by Monte Carlo analysis using unit process datasets with a negligible computation time.
Conclusions Independent sampling should not be used for comparative LCA. Moreover, the use of a one-size-fits-all correction factor to correct the calculated variability under independent sampling, as proposed elsewhere, is generally inadequate. The proposed approximate analytical approach is useful to estimate the importance of the covariance of aggregated datasets but not for comparative LCA. The approach based on dependently presampled results provides quick and correct results and has been implemented in EcodEX, a streamlined LCA software used by Nestlé. Dependently presampled results can be used for streamlined LCA software tools. Both presampling and analytical solutions require a preliminary one-time calculation of dependent samples for all aggregated datasets, which could be centrally done by database providers. The dependent presampling approach can be applied to other aspects of the LCA calculation chain.},

Yet, a full Monte Carlo analysis of a large LCA system, for instance containing the 4,000 unit processes of ecoinvent v2.2, is rarely carried out by LCA practitioners. One reason for this is computation time. An alternative faster than Monte Carlo method is analytical error propagation by means of a Taylor series expansion; however, this approach suffers from being explained in the literature in conflicting ways, hampering implementation in most software packages for LCA. The purpose of this paper is to compare the two different approaches from a theoretical and practical perspective.},

          , 
            Prices of lithium-ion battery technologies have fallen rapidly and substantially, by about 97\%, since their commercialization three decades ago. Many efforts have contributed to the cost reduction underlying the observed price decline, but the contributions of these efforts and their relative importance remain unclear. Here we address this gap by developing a set of cost change models to disentangle these efforts and estimate their individual contributions to the cost decline of lithium-ion cells. We collect data on lithium-ion cell components and their prices, develop a cost equation and cost change equations for these cells, and estimate the contributions of different low-level mechanisms of cost reduction, such as the impacts of changes in energy capacity characteristics, reductions in material prices, and changes in non-material costs. We find that between the late 1990s and early 2010s, about 38\% of the observed cost decline resulted from efforts to increase cell charge density. Meanwhile, reductions in cathode materials prices contributed 18\% of the cost reduction, and changes in non-material costs accounted for 14\% of the cost decline. We also consider the contributions of high-level mechanisms, including research and development (R\&D), learning-by-doing, and economies of scale. We find that the largest share of cost change was driven by public and private research and development, which we estimate contributed a majority of the observed cost reduction, with a lower contribution from economies of scale. Moreover, we find that the majority of the R\&D contribution can be attributed to advancements in chemistry and materials science. Looking to the future, these results suggest that the nature of electrochemical battery technology, which often allows for many different combinations of electrode materials and electrolyte chemistries, presents further opportunities for new approaches and cost decline in batteries. However, public policy may be needed to help avoid premature lock-in, which can result from market forces favoring incumbent technologies.},

	abstract = {Photovoltaic (PV) module costs have declined rapidly over forty years but the reasons remain elusive. Here we advance a conceptual framework and quantitative method for quantifying the causes of cost changes in a technology, and apply it to PV modules. Our method begins with a cost model that breaks down cost into variables that changed over time. Cost change equations are then derived to quantify each variable's contribution. We distinguish between changes observed in variables of the cost model – which we term low-level mechanisms of cost reduction – and research and development, learning-by-doing, and scale economies, which we refer to as high-level mechanisms. We find that increased module efficiency was the leading low-level cause of cost reduction in 1980–2012, contributing almost 25\% of the decline. Government-funded and private R\&D was the most important high-level mechanism over this period. After 2001, however, scale economies became a more significant cause of cost reduction, approaching R\&D in importance. Policies that stimulate market growth have played a key role in enabling PV's cost reduction, through privately-funded R\&D and scale economies, and to a lesser extent learning-by-doing. The method presented here can be adapted to retrospectively or prospectively study many technologies, and performance metrics besides cost.},

	abstract = {To analyze and understand historical changes in economic, environmental, employment or other socio-economic indicators, it is useful to assess the driving forces or determinants that underlie these changes. Two techniques for decomposing indicator changes at the sector level are structural decomposition analysis (SDA) and index decomposition analysis (IDA). For example, SDA and IDA have been used to analyze changes in indicators such as energy use, CO2-emissions, labor demand and value added. The changes in these variables are decomposed into determinants such as technological, demand, and structural effects. SDA uses information from input–output tables while IDA uses aggregate data at the sector-level. The two methods have developed quite independently, which has resulted in each method being characterized by specific, unique techniques and approaches. This paper has three aims. First, the similarities and differences between the two approaches are summarized. Second, the possibility of transferring specific techniques and indices is explored. Finally, a numerical example is used to illustrate differences between the two approaches.},

	abstract = {Structural decomposition analysis (SDA) is a well-known methodology to assess the relative importance of effects that together constitute the actual change in a variable of interest. A widely recognized problem of SDA is that the results often depend strongly on the speciﬁc decomposition formula chosen, while numerous formulae are equivalent from a theoretical point of view. This ‘non-uniqueness’ problem is often solved rather pragmatically, by reporting an average over (a subset of) all possible formulae. In this paper, we propose an approach that uses maximum entropy econometrics techniques to select a speciﬁc decomposition formula if additional information on one or more (but not all) determinants is available. We illustrate the method empirically by investigating the sources of change in real labour costs by industry in Spain, 1980– 1994.},

In an empirical analysisfor The Netherlands between 1986 and 1992, results are calculatedfor 24 equivalent decompositionforms. The outcomes exhibit a large degree of variability across the different forms. We also examine the two approaches that have been used predominantly in the literature. The average of the two so-called polar decompositions appears to be remarkably close to the average of the full set of 24 decompositions. The approximate decomposition with mid-point weights appears to be almost exact.

To address these questions, emission scenarios which range from business-as-usual to deep decarbonization scenarios have been developed by researchers using different assessment models. An understanding of the sources of variations across the range of these emission trajectories is of interest for discussions, debates and policy planning. However, since these models often have different structures and input variables, comparisons of the results are not straightforward. In this regard, index decomposition analysis (IDA) has emerged as a tool to facilitate comparisons in a harmonized way. It allows differences in emissions over time or between models to be broken down based on a set of accepted driving factors. This paper reviews the literature and summarizes the features and challenges. A multi-level scenario decomposition framework is proposed to address the challenges which include how to quantify differences arising from the energy transformation sector, the adoption of renewable energy, carbon capture and storage, and bio-energy carbon capture and storage technologies. A case study and guidelines for implementing the framework are presented.},

In the absence of nuclear war, leaders' expectations of nuclear war and of its control were affected by causal theories and abstract propositions and models which, given their “scientific” and technical nature, were developed by an epistemic community. This study, which emphasizes the roles played by epistemic communities in policy innovation and in the diffusion of understandings across nations and communities, analyzes how the theoretical and practical ideas of the arms control epistemic community became political expectations, were diffused to the Soviet Union, and were ultimately embodied in the 1972 antiballistic missile (ABM) arms control treaty. In contrast to those studies that have concentrated primarily on the workings of international epistemic communities, this study stresses the notion that domestically developed theoretical expectations, which were worked out by a national group of experts and selected by the American government as the basis for negotiations with the Soviets, became the seed of the ABM regime. Moreover, by suggesting that the arms control epistemic community was really an aggregation of several factions that shared common ground against various intellectual and policy rivals, this study sheds light on the question of how much coherence an epistemic community requires. The political selection of new conceptual understandings, followed by their retention and diffusion at national and international levels, suggests an evolutionary approach at odds with explanations of international change advanced by structural realism and approaches based on it.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The modern project of creating human-like artificial intelligence (AI) started after World War II, when it was discovered that electronic computers are not just number-crunching machines, but can also manipulate symbols. It is possible to pursue this goal without assuming that machine intelligence is identical to human intelligence. This is known as weak AI. However, many AI researcher have pursued the aim of developing artificial intelligence that is in principle identical to human intelligence, called strong AI. Weak AI is less ambitious than strong AI, and therefore less controversial. However, there are important controversies related to weak AI as well. This paper focuses on the distinction between artificial general intelligence (AGI) and artificial narrow intelligence (ANI). Although AGI may be classified as weak AI, it is close to strong AI because one chief characteristics of human intelligence is its generality. Although AGI is less ambitious than strong AI, there were critics almost from the very beginning. One of the leading critics was the philosopher Hubert Dreyfus, who argued that computers, who have no body, no childhood and no cultural practice, could not acquire intelligence at all. One of Dreyfus’ main arguments was that human knowledge is partly tacit, and therefore cannot be articulated and incorporated in a computer program. However, today one might argue that new approaches to artificial intelligence research have made his arguments obsolete. Deep learning and Big Data are among the latest approaches, and advocates argue that they will be able to realize AGI. A closer look reveals that although development of artificial intelligence for specific purposes (ANI) has been impressive, we have not come much closer to developing artificial general intelligence (AGI). The article further argues that this is in principle impossible, and it revives Hubert Dreyfus’ argument that computers are not in the world.},

Bringing together contributions from all over the world, this handbook includes sections devoted to each of the four pillars. Moreover, as the financialization of commodity markets has made risk analysis more complicated and intriguing the sections also cover energy commodity markets and their links to other financial and non-financial markets. In addition, econometric modelling and the forecasting of energy needs, as well as energy prices and volatilities, are also explored. Each section emphasises the multidisciplinary nature of the energy economics field and from this perspective, chapters offer a review of models and methods used in the literature.

A widely recognized problem of SDA is that the results often depend strongly on the speciﬁc decomposition formula chosen, while numerous formulae are equivalent from a theoretical point of view. This ‘non-uniqueness’ problem is often solved rather pragmatically, by reporting an average over (a subset of) all possible formulae. In this paper, we propose an approach that uses maximum entropy econometrics techniques to select a speciﬁc decomposition formula if additional information on one or more (but not all) determinants is available. We illustrate the method empirically by investigating the sources of change in real labour costs by industry in Spain, 1980– 1994.},

Here we advance a conceptual framework and quantitative method for quantifying the causes of cost changes in a technology, and apply it to PV modules. Our method begins with a cost model that breaks down cost into variables that changed over time. Cost change equations are then derived to quantify each variable's contribution. We distinguish between changes observed in variables of the cost model – which we term low-level mechanisms of cost reduction – and research and development, learning-by-doing, and scale economies, which we refer to as high-level mechanisms. We find that increased module efficiency was the leading low-level cause of cost reduction in 1980–2012, contributing almost 25\% of the decline. Government-funded and private R\&D was the most important high-level mechanism over this period. After 2001, however, scale economies became a more significant cause of cost reduction, approaching R\&D in importance. Policies that stimulate market growth have played a key role in enabling PV's cost reduction, through privately-funded R\&D and scale economies, and to a lesser extent learning-by-doing. The method presented here can be adapted to retrospectively or prospectively study many technologies, and performance metrics besides cost.},

              A large variety of energy storage systems are currently investigated for using surplus power from intermittent renewable energy sources. Typically, these energy storage systems are compared based on their Power-to-Power reconversion efficiency. Such a comparison, however, is inappropriate for energy storage systems not providing electric power as output. We therefore present a systematic environmental comparison of energy storage systems providing different products. As potential products, we consider the reconversion to power but also mobility, heat, fuels and chemical feedstock. Using life cycle assessment, we determine the environmental impacts avoided by using 1 MW h of surplus electricity in the energy storage systems instead of producing the same product in a conventional process. Based on data for several countries including the United States, Brazil, Japan, Germany and the United Kingdom, our analysis determines the highest reduction of global warming and fossil depletion impact for using surplus power in heat pumps with hot water storage and battery electric vehicles. Third highest environmental benefits are achieved by electrical energy storage systems (pumped hydro storage, compressed air energy storage and redox flow batteries). Environmental benefits are also obtained if surplus power is used to produce hydrogen but the benefits are lower. Our environmental assessment of energy storage systems is complemented by determination of CO

However, the existing electrical grid systems in place globally are not equipped to handle mass scale integration of intermittent energy sources without serious disruptions to the grid. It is generally agreed that more than 20\% penetration from intermittent renewables can greatly destabilize the grid system. Certainly, large-scale electrical energy storage systems may alleviate many of the inherent inefficiencies and deficiencies in the grid system, and help improve grid reliability, facilitate full integration of intermittent renewable sources, and effectively manage power generation. Electrical energy storage offers two other important advantages. First, it decouples electricity generation from the load or electricity user, thus making it easier to regulate supply and demand. Second, it allows distributed storage opportunities for local grids, or microgrids, which greatly improve grid security, and hence, energy security. Currently, there is nearly 170 GW of installed storage capacity around the world, but more than 96\% is provided by pumped-hydro, which is site-constrained and not available widely. Hence, a broad portfolio of technologies is needed to fully address the widely varying needs for large-scale electrical storage.},

In this work, we evaluate energy storage with a regenerative hydrogen fuel cell (RHFC) using net energy analysis. We examine the most widely installed RHFC conﬁguration, containing an alkaline water electrolyzer and a PEM fuel cell. To compare RHFC’s to other storage technologies, we use two energy return ratios: the electrical energy stored on invested (ESOIe) ratio (the ratio of electrical energy returned by the device over its lifetime to the electrical-equivalent energy required to build the device) and the overall energy efﬁciency (the ratio of electrical energy returned by the device over its lifetime to total lifetime electrical-equivalent energy input into the system).

              Numerous adsorption-based technologies are emerging as candidates for hydrogen transportation, and yet little is known about their practical viability. As such, new approaches are needed to conduct early validation of emerging hydrogen transportation concepts despite a lack of clear criteria for viable future hydrogen supply chains. In this work, we conduct technoeconomic modeling to quantify cost, performance, and relations between system components for early-stage adsorbent-based hydrogen supply chains. We compare results with the cost and performance of high pressure compressed gas and liquid hydrogen trucks in the same applications. Using available experimental adsorption data, we simulate the gravimetric performance of tube trailer trucks packed with metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) operated at 100 bar and 77 or 200 K. We also extrapolated available experimental data to study a third scenario where tube trailer trucks are operated at ambient temperature and 250 bar. Models developed for these conditions represent feasible operation scenarios where pressurization or cooling costs can be reduced relative to compressed or liquid hydrogen truck systems. Results suggest that the levelized cost of long-distance transmission, including a gas terminal and MOF-based truck fleet, ranges from \$7.3 to \$29.0 per kg H

          , 
            Lithium-ion technologies are increasingly employed to electrify transportation and provide stationary energy storage for electrical grids, and as such their development has garnered much attention. However, their deployment is still relatively limited, and their broader adoption will depend on their potential for cost reduction and performance improvement. Understanding this potential can inform critical climate change mitigation strategies, including public policies and technology development efforts. However, many existing estimates of past cost decline, which often serve as starting points for forecasting models, rely on limited data series and measures of technological progress. Here we systematically collect, harmonize, and combine various data series of price, market size, research and development, and performance of lithium-ion technologies. We then develop representative series for these measures, while separating cylindrical cells from all types of cells. For both, we find that the real price of lithium-ion cells, scaled by their energy capacity, has declined by about 97\% since their commercial introduction in 1991. We estimate that between 1992 and 2016, real price per energy capacity declined 13\% per year for both all types of cells and cylindrical cells, and upon a doubling of cumulative market size, decreased 20\% for all types of cells and 24\% for cylindrical cells. We also consider additional performance characteristics including energy density and specific energy. When energy density is incorporated into the definition of service provided by a lithium-ion battery, estimated technological improvement rates increase considerably. The annual decline in real price per service increases from 13 to 17\% for both all types of cells and cylindrical cells while learning rates increase from 20 to 27\% for all cell shapes and 24 to 31\% for cylindrical cells. These increases suggest that previously reported improvement rates might underestimate the rate of lithium-ion technologies' change. Moreover, our improvement rate estimates suggest the degree to which lithium-ion technologies' price decline might have been limited by performance requirements other than cost per energy capacity. These rates also suggest that battery technologies developed for stationary applications, where restrictions on volume and mass are relaxed, might achieve faster cost declines, though engineering-based mechanistic cost modeling is required to further characterize this potential. The methods employed to collect these data and estimate improvement rates are designed to serve as a blueprint for how to work with sparse data when making consequential measurements of technological change.},

              Many studies have quantified the cost of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) power plants, but relatively few discuss or appreciate the unique value this technology provides to the electricity system. CCS is routinely identified as a key factor in least-cost transitions to a low-carbon electricity system in 2050, one with significant value by providing dispatchable and low-carbon electricity. This paper investigates production, demand and stability characteristics of the current and future electricity system. We analyse the Carbon Intensity (CI) of electricity systems composed of unabated thermal (coal and gas), abated (CCS), and wind power plants for different levels of wind availability with a view to quantifying the value to the system of different generation mixes. As a thought experiment we consider the supply side of a UK-sized electricity system and compare the effect of combining wind and CCS capacity with unabated thermal power plants. The resulting capacity mix, system cost and CI are used to highlight the importance of differentiating between intermittent and firm low-carbon power generators. We observe that, in the absence of energy storage or demand side management, the deployment of intermittent renewable capacity cannot significantly displace unabated thermal power, and consequently can achieve only moderate reductions in overall CI. A system deploying sufficient wind capacity to meet peak demand can reduce CI from 0.78 t
              CO2

	abstract = {This technoeconomic analysis revisits the concept of thin silicon wafer for its potential cost benefits and technological challenges.
          , 
            Crystalline silicon comprises 90\% of the global photovoltaics (PV) market and has sustained a nearly 30\% cumulative annual growth rate, yet comprises less than 2\% of electricity capacity. To sustain this growth trajectory, continued cost and capital expenditure (capex) reductions are needed. Thinning the silicon wafer well below the industry-standard 160 μm, in principle reduces both manufacturing cost and capex, and accelerates economically-sustainable expansion of PV manufacturing. In this analysis piece, we explore two questions surrounding adoption of thin silicon wafers: (a) What are the market benefits of thin wafers? (b) What are the technological challenges to adopt thin wafers? In this analysis, we re-evaluate the benefits and challenges of thin Si for current and future PV modules using a comprehensive technoeconomic framework that couples device simulation, bottom-up cost modeling, and a sustainable cash-flow growth model. When adopting an advanced technology concept that features sufficiently good surface passivation, the comparable efficiencies are achievable for both 50 μm wafers and 160 μm ones. We then quantify the economic benefits for thin Si wafers in terms of poly-Si-to-module manufacturing capex, module cost, and levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for utility PV systems. Particularly, LCOE favors thinner wafers for all investigated device architectures, and can potentially be reduced by more than 5\% from the value of 160 μm wafers. With further improvements in module efficiency, an advanced device concept with 50 μm wafers could potentially reduce manufacturing capex by 48\%, module cost by 28\%, and LCOE by 24\%. Furthermore, we apply a sustainable growth model to investigate PV deployment scenarios in 2030. It is found that the state-of-the-art industry concept could not achieve the climate targets even with very aggressive financial scenarios, therefore the capex reduction benefit of thin wafers is advantageous to facilitate faster PV adoption. Lastly, we discuss the remaining technological challenges and areas for innovation to enable high-yield manufacturing of high-efficiency PV modules with thin Si wafers.},

              methane) will lead to dramatic energy efficiency improvements through the use of high efficiency electrical motors and complete elimination of direct CO
              2
              emissions. Despite the technical feasibility of the electrically-driven Haber–Bosch ammonia, the question still remains whether such revolution will take place. We reveal that its success relies on two factors: increased energy efficiency and the development of small-scale, distributed and agile processes that can align to the geographically isolated and intermittent renewable energy sources. The former requires not only higher electrolyser efficiencies for hydrogen production but also a holistic approach to the ammonia synthesis loop with the replacement of the condensation separation step by alternative technologies such as absorption and catalysis development. Such innovations will open the door to moderate pressure systems, the development and deployment of novel ammonia synthesis catalysts, and even more importantly, the opportunity for integration of reaction and separation steps to overcome equilibrium limitations. When realised, green ammonia will reshape the current energy landscape by directly replacing fossil fuels in transportation, heating, electricity,
              etc.

This papers derives, an equation connecting the radiated gravitational power with the electromagnetic energy injected between reflective plates.

SDFA are VTOL aircraft able to achieve unrivaled safety. In addition, SDFA would be able to exceed the efficiency of any other aircraft, easy to operate, inexpensive to manufacture and maintain, i.e., would be practical air-cars. An SDFA has three main components: 1) a wave generator, which generates mechanical power, 2) the VPS, which converts this power into lift with maximum efficiency and also controls attitude and 3) a rigid reflector which allows steady-state VPS operation. The design of circular SDFA is analyzed in detail here. Other configurations are also discussed.},

No empirical evidence is found for a saturation in per-capita consumption of light, even in contemporary developed nations. Finally, we extrapolate to the world in 2005, and ﬁnd that 0.72 percent (\$437B/year) of world gross domestic product and 6.5 percent (29.5 Quads/year) of world primary energy was used to produce 130 Plmh/year of artiﬁcial light.},

We define tech­ nological breakthroughs as inventions that are initially novel to a technological field but become increasingly relevant for describing the development of the field over time. We operationalize these notions of novelty and relevance by applying topic modeling to a corpus of the full text of patents in a technological field. The identified topics define a “technological space,” from which we develop continuous measures of a patent’s novelty and relevance to the mainstream trajectory of technological development in this space over time. Our method allows us to identify potential breakthrough inventions that may have driven changes to the rate and direction of technological development in the focal field. We apply the method to silicon solar photovoltaic patents granted in the United States between 1977 and 1996, generating a list of 98 patents representing potential breakthroughs that can be subsequently validated with other approaches. This method can help researchers identify sources and patterns of technological breakthroughs to inform research and development policy.},

With geometries similar to the incandescent bulb, and being produced when there was a high demand for energy conservation, these lamps boomed especially in connection with, mostly electronic, integral ballasts, thus being applicable in almost any incandescent fixture. Giving new impetus to luminaire design, today this new lamp family also covers lighting applications which, for a long time, were restricted to 'normal', double-capped fluorescent lamps.},
